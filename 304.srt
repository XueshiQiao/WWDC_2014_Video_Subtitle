&gt;&gt; Good afternoon everyone.

00:00:15.096 --> 00:00:15.976 A:middle
All right.

00:00:16.146 --> 00:00:18.956 A:middle
All right.

6
00:00:19.216 --> 00:00:20.536 A:middle
Let's have some fun today.

7
00:00:20.536 --> 00:00:20.826 A:middle
All right.

8
00:00:21.396 --> 00:00:22.106 A:middle
Thank you for coming.

9
00:00:22.396 --> 00:00:24.846 A:middle
This is a session not
just creating app previews

10
00:00:24.846 --> 00:00:27.336 A:middle
but creating great app previews.

11
00:00:27.786 --> 00:00:28.926 A:middle
And I really believe that.

12
00:00:28.926 --> 00:00:31.416 A:middle
After this session, I believe
you're going to be able

13
00:00:31.416 --> 00:00:32.636 A:middle
to create a great app preview.

14
00:00:33.206 --> 00:00:34.376 A:middle
My name is Paul Turner and I'm

15
00:00:34.676 --> 00:00:37.436 A:middle
from the iTunes Engineering
Division.

16
00:00:37.796 --> 00:00:41.496 A:middle
And what that fancy title behind
you says, is that I have a job

17
00:00:41.636 --> 00:00:43.236 A:middle
that requires many talents.

18
00:00:43.956 --> 00:00:45.356 A:middle
It's true.

19
00:00:45.796 --> 00:00:50.856 A:middle
Not only do I run several teams
that keep content processing

20
00:00:50.926 --> 00:00:53.286 A:middle
such as your apps, processing
and flowing to the store.

21
00:00:53.706 --> 00:00:56.646 A:middle
But in my 10 years at Apple,
I've been lucky enough

22
00:00:56.646 --> 00:00:59.836 A:middle
to be able to participate
in producing and engineering

23
00:00:59.836 --> 00:01:01.846 A:middle
and launching incredible
projects.

24
00:01:02.316 --> 00:01:05.346 A:middle
One of my first projects was
with some of these people

25
00:01:05.346 --> 00:01:05.976 A:middle
in the front here,

26
00:01:05.976 --> 00:01:08.966 A:middle
it was actually the
original App Store launch.

27
00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:13.766 A:middle
Since then, we've done
iBooks Store and HD films

28
00:01:13.766 --> 00:01:18.066 A:middle
and iTunes Extras and LPs and
iTunes Match and The Beatles.

29
00:01:18.356 --> 00:01:20.246 A:middle
It's been awesome.

30
00:01:20.336 --> 00:01:21.186 A:middle
This isn't about me.

31
00:01:21.606 --> 00:01:26.296 A:middle
What's actually relevant to
you guys though is that one

32
00:01:26.296 --> 00:01:29.066 A:middle
of the teams that I run is
actually the logistics team

33
00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:30.496 A:middle
for apps made by Apple.

34
00:01:30.856 --> 00:01:34.746 A:middle
So, not only do I help engineer
and support iTunes Connect

35
00:01:34.746 --> 00:01:36.656 A:middle
but I am a customer of
it, just like you guys.

36
00:01:37.426 --> 00:01:37.726 A:middle
All right.

37
00:01:37.896 --> 00:01:42.086 A:middle
So, let's talk about you and
your apps and your app previews.

38
00:01:42.956 --> 00:01:48.116 A:middle
First, I want to talk about
how content is previewed

39
00:01:48.116 --> 00:01:49.526 A:middle
to customers on the store.

40
00:01:50.806 --> 00:01:55.376 A:middle
Currently, with our
amazing and innovative

41
00:01:55.376 --> 00:01:56.846 A:middle
and boundless music store,

42
00:01:57.496 --> 00:01:59.276 A:middle
we have those great
90-second previews.

43
00:01:59.276 --> 00:01:59.696 A:middle
I love them.

44
00:02:00.076 --> 00:02:01.926 A:middle
I sit and click and
buy all day long.

45
00:02:01.926 --> 00:02:05.376 A:middle
And for my favorite
store, the film store,

46
00:02:05.376 --> 00:02:07.196 A:middle
we have those great
theatrical trailers.

47
00:02:07.196 --> 00:02:09.606 A:middle
And for the TV store, we
have episode previews.

48
00:02:10.395 --> 00:02:13.626 A:middle
And for everyone's
favorite, the iBooks Store,

49
00:02:13.756 --> 00:02:16.296 A:middle
we have those enticing
downloadable samples.

50
00:02:16.296 --> 00:02:18.066 A:middle
So, what do we have
for the App Store?

51
00:02:18.936 --> 00:02:22.756 A:middle
This week, we're
introducing app previews.

52
00:02:23.486 --> 00:02:24.376 A:middle
So, let's get to know them.

53
00:02:24.376 --> 00:02:24.906 A:middle
Yeah, whoo!

54
00:02:24.906 --> 00:02:25.886 A:middle
You're allowed to clap.

55
00:02:26.016 --> 00:02:27.106 A:middle
[ Applause ]

56
00:02:27.106 --> 00:02:27.746 A:middle
This is great.

57
00:02:27.806 --> 00:02:28.406 A:middle
This is good.

58
00:02:28.406 --> 00:02:29.806 A:middle
This is amazing.

59
00:02:30.546 --> 00:02:30.726 A:middle
All right.

60
00:02:30.726 --> 00:02:32.066 A:middle
Let's get to know app previews.

61
00:02:32.066 --> 00:02:32.756 A:middle
This is fun.

62
00:02:32.756 --> 00:02:34.606 A:middle
Let's pick it up where
Tim left us on Monday.

63
00:02:34.606 --> 00:02:37.116 A:middle
With that app that he
showed, Monument Valley.

64
00:02:37.116 --> 00:02:41.206 A:middle
And let's take a look at the way
that it's previewed to customers

65
00:02:41.206 --> 00:02:45.676 A:middle
on the store right now.

66
00:02:45.676 --> 00:02:46.546 A:middle
It's pretty.

67
00:02:47.366 --> 00:02:47.666 A:middle
All right.

68
00:02:47.666 --> 00:02:50.106 A:middle
So, on the store, on the store's
product page, you're going

69
00:02:50.106 --> 00:02:50.956 A:middle
to have description text.

70
00:02:50.956 --> 00:02:52.316 A:middle
You're going to have other
information but, you know,

71
00:02:52.316 --> 00:02:53.686 A:middle
a picture is worth
a thousand words.

72
00:02:54.006 --> 00:02:56.436 A:middle
Let's look at these screenshots
and they're beautiful.

73
00:02:56.646 --> 00:02:57.226 A:middle
They're beautiful.

74
00:02:57.226 --> 00:02:58.076 A:middle
They're gorgeous.

75
00:02:58.476 --> 00:02:59.686 A:middle
It's an amazing app.

76
00:03:00.396 --> 00:03:03.746 A:middle
But I'm curious as a customer,
I don't fully understand it.

77
00:03:03.746 --> 00:03:05.596 A:middle
I don't understand
how the app functions.

78
00:03:06.516 --> 00:03:07.636 A:middle
This is app previews.

79
00:03:08.136 --> 00:03:11.506 A:middle
So, if a picture is
worth a thousand words,

80
00:03:11.736 --> 00:03:12.546 A:middle
what's a video worth?

81
00:03:13.066 --> 00:03:14.976 A:middle
And this is it.

82
00:03:15.516 --> 00:03:45.546 A:middle
[ Music ]

83
00:03:46.046 --> 00:03:49.626 A:middle
Right before our eyes, Monument
Valley becomes this immersive

84
00:03:50.046 --> 00:03:50.926 A:middle
puzzle game.

85
00:03:51.116 --> 00:03:53.216 A:middle
And you make an immediate
emotional connection.

86
00:03:53.576 --> 00:03:55.066 A:middle
And that's app previews.

87
00:03:55.956 --> 00:03:58.416 A:middle
So, I want to start off,
get us all on the same page

88
00:03:59.346 --> 00:04:00.856 A:middle
with just some basic
information.

89
00:04:01.776 --> 00:04:04.976 A:middle
App previews are up to
30 seconds in length.

90
00:04:05.336 --> 00:04:10.556 A:middle
App previews are not really
brand or campaign-focused.

91
00:04:11.116 --> 00:04:13.266 A:middle
They are not full of cut scenes.

92
00:04:13.536 --> 00:04:15.126 A:middle
They're definitely not
theatrical trailers.

93
00:04:15.126 --> 00:04:18.076 A:middle
They're just brief videos
meant to demonstrate the UI,

94
00:04:18.336 --> 00:04:21.086 A:middle
the features or the
functionality of your app.

95
00:04:21.706 --> 00:04:25.806 A:middle
App previews are made
primarily of captured footage.

96
00:04:26.036 --> 00:04:29.476 A:middle
And we're going to show you how
to do that live on stage today.

97
00:04:29.556 --> 00:04:33.586 A:middle
And once you're finished
producing your app preview,

98
00:04:33.626 --> 00:04:36.816 A:middle
you're going to export out
a high-resolution source

99
00:04:37.156 --> 00:04:38.266 A:middle
that you're going
to upload right

100
00:04:38.266 --> 00:04:39.936 A:middle
into iTunes Connect very easy.

101
00:04:40.356 --> 00:04:42.336 A:middle
It's going to be reviewed
along with your binary.

102
00:04:42.376 --> 00:04:43.906 A:middle
We're going to re-encode
it for streaming

103
00:04:43.906 --> 00:04:46.126 A:middle
out to devices all
around the world.

104
00:04:46.606 --> 00:04:47.636 A:middle
It's incredible.

105
00:04:48.386 --> 00:04:50.916 A:middle
So, with that, let's talk
about the agenda today.

106
00:04:52.206 --> 00:04:54.346 A:middle
First off, we're going to
go over a little bit more

107
00:04:54.346 --> 00:04:56.356 A:middle
of the details in app
previews, the characteristics,

108
00:04:56.356 --> 00:04:57.346 A:middle
what makes them different

109
00:04:57.346 --> 00:04:58.816 A:middle
than anything you've
really seen before.

110
00:04:58.816 --> 00:05:01.456 A:middle
We're going to help you
take that first step.

111
00:05:01.456 --> 00:05:02.936 A:middle
And that's kind of the
most important step is,

112
00:05:03.316 --> 00:05:06.506 A:middle
the planning step, how to
plan your video creatively

113
00:05:06.746 --> 00:05:07.536 A:middle
and technically.

114
00:05:07.946 --> 00:05:11.576 A:middle
We're going to show you
that capture feature

115
00:05:12.106 --> 00:05:13.396 A:middle
and it's amazing and I love it.

116
00:05:13.396 --> 00:05:15.596 A:middle
We're also going to do
a little bit of editing.

117
00:05:15.596 --> 00:05:18.116 A:middle
We're going to show your
editing options with iMovie.

118
00:05:19.486 --> 00:05:21.966 A:middle
Next, we're going to show
you some composition tips.

119
00:05:22.496 --> 00:05:25.046 A:middle
We're going to demonstrate
the uploading right

120
00:05:25.046 --> 00:05:26.016 A:middle
into iTunes Connect.

121
00:05:26.226 --> 00:05:29.676 A:middle
And we'll round out everything
at the end with some guidelines.

122
00:05:29.866 --> 00:05:30.956 A:middle
Does that sound good
to everybody?

123
00:05:31.006 --> 00:05:34.786 A:middle
Yes, OK. It's OK to talk.

124
00:05:36.016 --> 00:05:36.946 A:middle
It's interactive.

125
00:05:37.546 --> 00:05:37.946 A:middle
All right.

126
00:05:38.356 --> 00:05:41.196 A:middle
Let's talk about those details.

127
00:05:42.446 --> 00:05:42.936 A:middle
All right.

128
00:05:42.936 --> 00:05:43.706 A:middle
App previews.

129
00:05:43.976 --> 00:05:47.146 A:middle
App previews are a feature
of the iOS App Stores.

130
00:05:47.456 --> 00:05:49.426 A:middle
And as you saw on the
Monument Valley that Tim showed

131
00:05:49.426 --> 00:05:52.366 A:middle
and we just showed here, app
previews are going to show

132
00:05:52.366 --> 00:05:55.706 A:middle
up in the first slot
of the new section

133
00:05:55.926 --> 00:05:57.546 A:middle
for screenshots and videos.

134
00:05:57.546 --> 00:05:59.806 A:middle
So, that first slot will be
dedicated to app previews

135
00:05:59.806 --> 00:06:01.076 A:middle
and show up on the product page.

136
00:06:01.396 --> 00:06:07.006 A:middle
App previews are
device specific,

137
00:06:07.916 --> 00:06:09.596 A:middle
meaning that if you
have a universal app,

138
00:06:10.036 --> 00:06:14.606 A:middle
you will upload a distinct
iPhone and a distinct iPad video

139
00:06:14.606 --> 00:06:18.006 A:middle
for your app previews.

140
00:06:18.056 --> 00:06:19.576 A:middle
Also, we're making it very easy.

141
00:06:20.376 --> 00:06:22.766 A:middle
You're going to upload just
that single set of videos

142
00:06:22.766 --> 00:06:25.856 A:middle
to your apps primary
localization and we're going

143
00:06:25.856 --> 00:06:28.436 A:middle
to disperse them to
the other storefronts

144
00:06:28.646 --> 00:06:29.926 A:middle
that your app is for sale on.

145
00:06:30.836 --> 00:06:37.236 A:middle
A couple more details, we need
those beautiful widescreens

146
00:06:37.236 --> 00:06:38.756 A:middle
to show off your app preview.

147
00:06:38.756 --> 00:06:41.526 A:middle
So, app previews are going
to be a feature of iOS 8

148
00:06:41.526 --> 00:06:43.946 A:middle
and they're going to
display on those iPhone,

149
00:06:43.946 --> 00:06:47.106 A:middle
those widescreen iPhones, the
iPod touches, the iPhone 5,

150
00:06:47.106 --> 00:06:49.636 A:middle
the iPod touches, the iPads
and the Desktop Store.

151
00:06:50.186 --> 00:06:54.486 A:middle
One question I get a lot,
they're not required,

152
00:06:54.976 --> 00:06:56.596 A:middle
but they're strongly encouraged.

153
00:06:56.596 --> 00:06:58.086 A:middle
And I'm glad you guys
are all here today.

154
00:06:58.086 --> 00:06:58.936 A:middle
You've taken the first step.

155
00:06:58.936 --> 00:07:01.776 A:middle
We didn't want to
launch app previews

156
00:07:01.776 --> 00:07:03.856 A:middle
until we made everything
available

157
00:07:03.856 --> 00:07:05.536 A:middle
and accessible to
every developer.

158
00:07:05.536 --> 00:07:06.706 A:middle
And now that we're doing that,

159
00:07:06.846 --> 00:07:09.096 A:middle
we're strongly encouraging
everyone to get on board.

160
00:07:09.096 --> 00:07:10.226 A:middle
We really want you
to get on board.

161
00:07:10.526 --> 00:07:11.366 A:middle
We're here for the session.

162
00:07:11.366 --> 00:07:12.266 A:middle
We're going to be in the lab.

163
00:07:12.706 --> 00:07:14.296 A:middle
We're here to help you get
on board with app previews.

164
00:07:14.296 --> 00:07:15.186 A:middle
We just think they're amazing.

165
00:07:15.656 --> 00:07:17.846 A:middle
This is my favorite.

166
00:07:17.846 --> 00:07:19.486 A:middle
This is my favorite
of all, my favorite.

167
00:07:20.096 --> 00:07:23.466 A:middle
We have native aspect
ratio support built in.

168
00:07:24.236 --> 00:07:30.866 A:middle
No longer will you have
to stretch or pinch or add

169
00:07:31.996 --> 00:07:35.216 A:middle
that to your videos to fit
in a widescreen player.

170
00:07:35.526 --> 00:07:37.616 A:middle
I want that off the screen as
bad, it's just burning my eyes.

171
00:07:38.116 --> 00:07:40.376 A:middle
We have native aspect
ratio support right in,

172
00:07:40.376 --> 00:07:40.976 A:middle
built right in.

173
00:07:40.976 --> 00:07:45.576 A:middle
So, you get the full UI
video in the playback.

174
00:07:45.696 --> 00:07:46.706 A:middle
It's fantastic.

175
00:07:46.706 --> 00:07:51.426 A:middle
I want to talk about
planning next.

176
00:07:52.636 --> 00:07:54.286 A:middle
I'm sure you guys
are sitting here.

177
00:07:54.286 --> 00:07:56.186 A:middle
I'm giving you a little
bit of information.

178
00:07:56.666 --> 00:07:57.686 A:middle
Maybe the wheels are spinning.

179
00:07:57.686 --> 00:07:58.686 A:middle
Maybe you think about your app.

180
00:07:59.146 --> 00:08:00.446 A:middle
Maybe you're wondering
what you're going to do.

181
00:08:00.446 --> 00:08:01.486 A:middle
So, let's talk about planning.

182
00:08:01.486 --> 00:08:03.486 A:middle
Planning is the biggest part
about making your app preview.

183
00:08:03.486 --> 00:08:04.596 A:middle
The rest of it we
made really easy.

184
00:08:04.596 --> 00:08:08.486 A:middle
So, planning is where you're
going to have to start.

185
00:08:08.486 --> 00:08:11.116 A:middle
First, you're going
to have to figure

186
00:08:11.116 --> 00:08:12.576 A:middle
out the goal of your
app preview.

187
00:08:12.576 --> 00:08:17.376 A:middle
Are you going to highlight
a feature, many features,

188
00:08:17.886 --> 00:08:20.426 A:middle
maybe the utility of your app?

189
00:08:20.706 --> 00:08:22.256 A:middle
Maybe you have a
really innovative UI.

190
00:08:23.466 --> 00:08:25.466 A:middle
Start thinking about
what your goal

191
00:08:25.466 --> 00:08:27.486 A:middle
of your 30-second app
preview is going to be.

192
00:08:28.446 --> 00:08:30.096 A:middle
And a great way to think

193
00:08:30.096 --> 00:08:33.116 A:middle
about this is what
makes my app magical

194
00:08:33.226 --> 00:08:34.196 A:middle
or what makes my app magic?

195
00:08:35.265 --> 00:08:38.926 A:middle
And an easy way to kind of put
yourself in that question is,

196
00:08:39.496 --> 00:08:42.096 A:middle
if somebody walked up to
you with your app, you know,

197
00:08:42.535 --> 00:08:43.496 A:middle
"Hey, I've got this app."

198
00:08:43.916 --> 00:08:44.436 A:middle
It's your app.

199
00:08:44.436 --> 00:08:46.326 A:middle
What would you want them to
say to you about the app?

200
00:08:47.026 --> 00:08:48.266 A:middle
You know, "Oh, I've
got this app.

201
00:08:48.626 --> 00:08:50.996 A:middle
It does this for phone basics."

202
00:08:51.266 --> 00:08:52.926 A:middle
Or, "Oh, I've got
this really cool app.

203
00:08:52.926 --> 00:08:55.696 A:middle
It revolutionizes
the way I...that"

204
00:08:56.136 --> 00:08:57.156 A:middle
or "What's your plan
over there?"

205
00:08:57.156 --> 00:08:59.176 A:middle
"Oh, this new cool
new game, it does this

206
00:08:59.176 --> 00:09:00.316 A:middle
and this character does that."

207
00:09:00.556 --> 00:09:02.076 A:middle
What makes your app magical?

208
00:09:02.586 --> 00:09:04.636 A:middle
You know, that's going to
make your magical app preview

209
00:09:04.636 --> 00:09:05.996 A:middle
and your app preview magical.

210
00:09:05.996 --> 00:09:09.726 A:middle
That's going to get people
to purchase your app.

211
00:09:10.246 --> 00:09:13.516 A:middle
Just like Monument Valley, you
saw those beautiful screenshots

212
00:09:13.516 --> 00:09:15.346 A:middle
and screenshots are
a very powerful tool.

213
00:09:15.726 --> 00:09:17.436 A:middle
But now, you have
this story to tell.

214
00:09:17.436 --> 00:09:21.036 A:middle
You have this...you have app
previews to fill in that story.

215
00:09:21.036 --> 00:09:23.106 A:middle
So, you're going to look
beyond your screenshots.

216
00:09:23.666 --> 00:09:27.646 A:middle
How do you tell your story
now with these videos?

217
00:09:27.646 --> 00:09:28.476 A:middle
It's fantastic.

218
00:09:28.986 --> 00:09:31.976 A:middle
A couple more things
on content planning.

219
00:09:32.296 --> 00:09:36.016 A:middle
So now, you started to figure
out what makes your app magical.

220
00:09:37.426 --> 00:09:40.346 A:middle
You're starting to
understand what your goal is.

221
00:09:41.146 --> 00:09:43.426 A:middle
Now, it's time to start
listing out these elements,

222
00:09:43.426 --> 00:09:45.026 A:middle
maybe list out the
elements that you want

223
00:09:45.026 --> 00:09:46.246 A:middle
to put in your app preview.

224
00:09:46.246 --> 00:09:49.456 A:middle
If you're an app that's already
on the store, a great place

225
00:09:49.456 --> 00:09:51.086 A:middle
to start would probably
be a description text,

226
00:09:51.086 --> 00:09:53.836 A:middle
that's probably your
first list today.

227
00:09:53.836 --> 00:09:55.346 A:middle
I bet every one of
you got bulleted list

228
00:09:55.346 --> 00:09:57.476 A:middle
in your description text right
now, you can just steal that,

229
00:09:58.216 --> 00:09:59.106 A:middle
put that in your list.

230
00:09:59.436 --> 00:10:00.976 A:middle
But add to it, start
playing with things.

231
00:10:01.316 --> 00:10:04.376 A:middle
Start thinking about what
your app is all about.

232
00:10:04.376 --> 00:10:07.086 A:middle
Or, "Oh man, I spent so much
time on this great level.

233
00:10:07.086 --> 00:10:08.546 A:middle
I really want to show this off.

234
00:10:08.546 --> 00:10:09.396 A:middle
Kids love this."

235
00:10:09.396 --> 00:10:11.666 A:middle
Or, "I get so much feedback
about this portion of my app,

236
00:10:11.666 --> 00:10:13.526 A:middle
that's a great thing to
put in my app preview."

237
00:10:14.326 --> 00:10:17.746 A:middle
And I-- having said that,
now I highly encourage you

238
00:10:18.616 --> 00:10:20.736 A:middle
to make some kind of
outline or storyboard.

239
00:10:20.736 --> 00:10:21.896 A:middle
And you see the storyboard
that we have

240
00:10:21.896 --> 00:10:22.936 A:middle
up on here-- on the screen.

241
00:10:22.936 --> 00:10:24.426 A:middle
This is for storyboard
but we're going

242
00:10:24.426 --> 00:10:25.786 A:middle
to actually show the app
preview this is based

243
00:10:25.786 --> 00:10:27.556 A:middle
on in a little bit.

244
00:10:27.846 --> 00:10:29.006 A:middle
But, it doesn't have
to be fancy.

245
00:10:29.006 --> 00:10:29.916 A:middle
You don't have to
be a greater drawer.

246
00:10:29.916 --> 00:10:31.336 A:middle
This is a fantastic drawing.

247
00:10:31.336 --> 00:10:32.776 A:middle
[Speaker laughs] It
could be on a napkin,

248
00:10:32.776 --> 00:10:34.626 A:middle
it could be on a
Chipotle napkin.

249
00:10:34.626 --> 00:10:37.336 A:middle
You know, it doesn't matter
what you're drawing it on.

250
00:10:37.336 --> 00:10:39.256 A:middle
It could be a series
of arrows and boxes

251
00:10:39.256 --> 00:10:40.776 A:middle
but start storyboarding it out.

252
00:10:41.076 --> 00:10:42.676 A:middle
What do I want to
show in my video?

253
00:10:42.676 --> 00:10:45.746 A:middle
How am I going to put the
story together, right?

254
00:10:45.746 --> 00:10:49.406 A:middle
And along those lines,
you probably want to work

255
00:10:49.406 --> 00:10:52.046 A:middle
with that list of
elements, your storyboard

256
00:10:52.046 --> 00:10:53.646 A:middle
and start working
with the timing.

257
00:10:53.646 --> 00:10:55.276 A:middle
Remember you have a
finite amount of time.

258
00:10:55.566 --> 00:10:57.526 A:middle
So say, "I like this element,

259
00:10:57.526 --> 00:10:58.856 A:middle
I really want to
show off this UI."

260
00:10:58.856 --> 00:11:00.566 A:middle
That takes about
5 seconds to load.

261
00:11:00.856 --> 00:11:02.666 A:middle
Let's start working
with the timing here.

262
00:11:03.116 --> 00:11:04.506 A:middle
This is the time in
the planning stage.

263
00:11:04.506 --> 00:11:06.506 A:middle
You don't want to get bogged
down in the production stage.

264
00:11:06.506 --> 00:11:08.786 A:middle
You don't want to be
working on your app preview

265
00:11:08.786 --> 00:11:11.356 A:middle
and still not know what you're
trying to accomplish by it.

266
00:11:11.956 --> 00:11:13.656 A:middle
So, part of the planning stage,

267
00:11:13.906 --> 00:11:15.896 A:middle
and these are all basic
things I'm telling here,

268
00:11:15.896 --> 00:11:18.206 A:middle
but I think it's good to
remind everyone, it'll get you

269
00:11:18.396 --> 00:11:21.586 A:middle
out of the weeds if you're
on the production process.

270
00:11:22.176 --> 00:11:25.336 A:middle
And one last thing on content
planning, just like screenshots,

271
00:11:25.936 --> 00:11:28.136 A:middle
you have to disclose all
your In-App Purchases.

272
00:11:28.786 --> 00:11:30.676 A:middle
So, that's a good time in
your planning stage to figure

273
00:11:30.676 --> 00:11:31.686 A:middle
out how you're going to do that.

274
00:11:32.036 --> 00:11:35.646 A:middle
If you're going to show the,
you know, the sword of thunder

275
00:11:35.866 --> 00:11:39.406 A:middle
and that cost 10,000 coins,
you're either going to have

276
00:11:39.406 --> 00:11:41.286 A:middle
to figure out how to
disclose that with some kind

277
00:11:41.286 --> 00:11:44.336 A:middle
of textural element or
maybe you want to show how

278
00:11:44.336 --> 00:11:48.856 A:middle
that in-app purchase was
purchased in your app preview.

279
00:11:49.296 --> 00:11:50.146 A:middle
So remember, you have

280
00:11:50.266 --> 00:11:53.356 A:middle
to disclose all your in-app
purchases, plan for it.

281
00:11:54.486 --> 00:11:55.176 A:middle
It's a good tip.

282
00:11:55.176 --> 00:11:55.666 A:middle
All right.

283
00:11:55.666 --> 00:11:57.986 A:middle
A couple of technical
things to go over.

284
00:11:59.466 --> 00:12:03.006 A:middle
If you're a universal app, you
might have a great storyboard,

285
00:12:03.246 --> 00:12:04.296 A:middle
might have a great plan.

286
00:12:05.126 --> 00:12:08.206 A:middle
But your iPad app
and your iPad version

287
00:12:08.206 --> 00:12:10.576 A:middle
and your iPhone version may
have different UI elements

288
00:12:10.576 --> 00:12:12.756 A:middle
that you want to highlight or
need to highlight or capture

289
00:12:12.756 --> 00:12:15.476 A:middle
in a different way to edit
into your app preview.

290
00:12:15.476 --> 00:12:17.896 A:middle
And the planning phase
is good to identify those

291
00:12:17.896 --> 00:12:20.286 A:middle
so you can capture them when
you need them to edit them

292
00:12:20.286 --> 00:12:22.436 A:middle
into your production process.

293
00:12:23.976 --> 00:12:25.886 A:middle
Next one. Oh, this
is a good one.

294
00:12:26.516 --> 00:12:30.496 A:middle
You know your customers
best, and so therefore,

295
00:12:30.496 --> 00:12:32.356 A:middle
we're going to allow you
to pick your language

296
00:12:32.616 --> 00:12:33.376 A:middle
for your app preview.

297
00:12:33.376 --> 00:12:36.276 A:middle
And remember, it goes on to
your apps primary localization,

298
00:12:36.276 --> 00:12:37.516 A:middle
but you need to choose
a language.

299
00:12:37.516 --> 00:12:39.806 A:middle
Now, yet again, you know
your customers best.

300
00:12:40.456 --> 00:12:43.196 A:middle
If your app's primary
localization is Japanese

301
00:12:44.166 --> 00:12:47.596 A:middle
and it's primarily sold
in Japan, but yet you know

302
00:12:47.596 --> 00:12:49.806 A:middle
that your customer is
expecting an English video,

303
00:12:49.806 --> 00:12:53.026 A:middle
as long as it passes guidelines,
we're going to allow it.

304
00:12:53.526 --> 00:12:55.006 A:middle
So, in the planning
phase, it's good to figure

305
00:12:55.006 --> 00:12:56.376 A:middle
out what language
you're going to use.

306
00:12:56.906 --> 00:12:59.886 A:middle
This is probably the most
obvious thing I'm going

307
00:12:59.886 --> 00:13:00.426 A:middle
to tell you today.

308
00:13:00.426 --> 00:13:03.806 A:middle
The demo accounts, if you're
app opens up to a login screen,

309
00:13:03.806 --> 00:13:05.226 A:middle
it's going to be a
really boring app preview.

310
00:13:05.766 --> 00:13:07.086 A:middle
So, you're probably going

311
00:13:07.086 --> 00:13:08.426 A:middle
to need some demo
accounts, you know.

312
00:13:08.806 --> 00:13:10.526 A:middle
And along those lines,
you may need

313
00:13:10.526 --> 00:13:14.296 A:middle
to stage some information
into those accounts.

314
00:13:14.296 --> 00:13:15.496 A:middle
If you're a social app,
you're going to need

315
00:13:15.496 --> 00:13:16.366 A:middle
to put some social media.

316
00:13:16.366 --> 00:13:17.626 A:middle
And if you're a calendar
app, you're going to need

317
00:13:17.626 --> 00:13:19.556 A:middle
to put some calendar
information in.

318
00:13:19.846 --> 00:13:22.986 A:middle
If you're a game and you really
want to show off that 4th level

319
00:13:22.986 --> 00:13:25.366 A:middle
that you, you know, kids really
love, you're going to have

320
00:13:25.366 --> 00:13:27.416 A:middle
to figure out a way to
get to that 4th level.

321
00:13:27.676 --> 00:13:31.216 A:middle
And I caution you, don't stage
anything in your app preview

322
00:13:31.216 --> 00:13:33.146 A:middle
that cannot be accomplished
in your app.

323
00:13:33.536 --> 00:13:35.656 A:middle
Your app preview has to
be represented of the app

324
00:13:35.656 --> 00:13:36.586 A:middle
that customer will buy.

325
00:13:36.956 --> 00:13:39.156 A:middle
It's just a caution, I know
none of you guys would do that,

326
00:13:39.186 --> 00:13:40.746 A:middle
but I just want to
warn you about that.

327
00:13:41.216 --> 00:13:46.566 A:middle
Also in staging, it's a good
idea, just like screenshots,

328
00:13:46.636 --> 00:13:48.426 A:middle
we can't have any advertisements
in the app preview,

329
00:13:48.426 --> 00:13:50.466 A:middle
so it's a good time
to stage those out.

330
00:13:51.256 --> 00:13:52.266 A:middle
Sound good?

331
00:13:52.836 --> 00:13:53.346 A:middle
All right.

332
00:13:53.456 --> 00:13:54.876 A:middle
Let's show you a
cool app preview now,

333
00:13:55.166 --> 00:13:55.976 A:middle
enough of me talking.

334
00:13:56.716 --> 00:14:01.646 A:middle
This is a preview from
our friends at Toco Boca,

335
00:14:02.436 --> 00:14:04.676 A:middle
for an app called Toca Labs.

336
00:14:04.916 --> 00:14:08.046 A:middle
And they just have put a
few captured clips together.

337
00:14:09.086 --> 00:14:12.586 A:middle
They demonstrate their quirky
art direction, their fun UI.

338
00:14:12.836 --> 00:14:15.486 A:middle
This is an app that gets
kids really involved

339
00:14:15.486 --> 00:14:16.886 A:middle
in experimentation in science.

340
00:14:16.886 --> 00:14:18.636 A:middle
It just gives you a
great picture of the app

341
00:14:18.636 --> 00:14:19.796 A:middle

All right.

354
00:15:03.466 --> 00:15:07.256 A:middle
Now, I want to move
on to my favorite part

355
00:15:07.256 --> 00:15:08.246 A:middle
about this, the capture.

356
00:15:08.316 --> 00:15:11.256 A:middle
And you need a really
expensive cable for this

357
00:15:11.846 --> 00:15:13.186 A:middle
and really lots of...no,
I'm kidding,

358
00:15:13.186 --> 00:15:14.506 A:middle
you just need a Lightning cable.

359
00:15:14.936 --> 00:15:16.926 A:middle
It's...we've made it
so easy, it's amazing.

All right.

361
00:15:17.396 --> 00:15:19.086 A:middle
A couple things about capture.

362
00:15:20.416 --> 00:15:25.136 A:middle
In OS X Yosemite and iOS 8,
you're going to be able to hook

363
00:15:25.136 --> 00:15:28.166 A:middle
up your device via a Lightning
cable, right to your Mac,

364
00:15:28.286 --> 00:15:31.786 A:middle
open up QuickTime Player and
your device's screen output

365
00:15:31.786 --> 00:15:35.096 A:middle
and audio are available
as inputs just

366
00:15:35.096 --> 00:15:36.006 A:middle
like a camera would be.

I love it, I love it.

373
00:15:44.796 --> 00:15:45.556 A:middle
It's fantastic.

374
00:15:46.586 --> 00:15:47.166 A:middle
All right.

375
00:15:47.546 --> 00:15:52.146 A:middle
So, to do this obviously,
you're going to need iOS devices

376
00:15:52.146 --> 00:15:53.226 A:middle
that require Lightning cables.

377
00:15:53.226 --> 00:15:56.286 A:middle
So, that's your iPod
touches, your iPhone 5 series,

378
00:15:56.536 --> 00:15:59.576 A:middle
your iPads, you needed the
Lightning cable support,

379
00:15:59.576 --> 00:16:00.806 A:middle
it only works over Lightning.

380
00:16:02.776 --> 00:16:06.096 A:middle
But, in true Apple
form, it just works.

381
00:16:06.376 --> 00:16:10.176 A:middle
No special modes, no clicking,
no shaking it over your head.

382
00:16:10.286 --> 00:16:12.176 A:middle
Stamp on it three
times and it works.

383
00:16:12.466 --> 00:16:14.686 A:middle
It's plugin, select
it in QuickTime,

384
00:16:14.686 --> 00:16:16.906 A:middle
we're going to show it to you
today, it's really amazing.

00:16:16.906 --> 00:16:18.326 A:middle
It just woks, I love that.

00:16:18.686 --> 00:16:20.226 A:middle
A couple tips for capture.

387
00:16:20.776 --> 00:16:26.216 A:middle
We want to display the
highest quality video and audio

388
00:16:26.216 --> 00:16:29.656 A:middle
to the customers and so
we've made this capture tool

389
00:16:29.656 --> 00:16:31.906 A:middle
so that you can capture
the highest quality video

390
00:16:31.906 --> 00:16:32.906 A:middle
and audio of your app.

391
00:16:33.296 --> 00:16:36.486 A:middle
You spend a lot of time
making...perfecting every pixel

392
00:16:36.486 --> 00:16:39.176 A:middle
in your UI and we want to
capture every single pixel

393
00:16:39.366 --> 00:16:42.616 A:middle
and make sure that the
customer sees how much love and,

394
00:16:42.616 --> 00:16:44.196 A:middle
you know, everything that
you put into your app.

395
00:16:44.486 --> 00:16:46.466 A:middle
So, we're hoping that you're
going to use these Apple tools.

396
00:16:47.006 --> 00:16:50.716 A:middle
A tip just like Toca
Boca did there,

397
00:16:50.716 --> 00:16:54.176 A:middle
you can start your capture
or, you know, you can edit

398
00:16:54.176 --> 00:16:55.416 A:middle
in from your splash screen.

399
00:16:55.416 --> 00:16:57.186 A:middle
It looks really kind
of cool if you want to.

400
00:16:57.636 --> 00:16:58.916 A:middle
But please don't
capture straight

401
00:16:58.916 --> 00:17:01.516 A:middle
from the home screen
going into your app

402
00:17:01.516 --> 00:17:05.165 A:middle
or if your app has inter-app
operability, don't switch back

403
00:17:05.165 --> 00:17:06.796 A:middle
and forth between apps.

404
00:17:07.086 --> 00:17:10.876 A:middle
This is about your single app
and its functions, let it shine,

405
00:17:10.876 --> 00:17:12.665 A:middle
capture only your app.

406
00:17:14.116 --> 00:17:18.506 A:middle
Go slow. I know that 30
seconds is scary to some of you

407
00:17:18.506 --> 00:17:20.415 A:middle
but really, you can make
some amazing app previews.

408

We're going to show
you a really awesome--

409
00:17:21.836 --> 00:17:23.406 A:middle
a couple awesome
30-second app previews

410
00:17:23.406 --> 00:17:24.705 A:middle
in a second, but go slow.

411
00:17:25.006 --> 00:17:27.306 A:middle
If your customer can't follow
along with what you're doing,

412
00:17:27.306 --> 00:17:29.326 A:middle
they're not going to
understand your app preview,

413
00:17:29.326 --> 00:17:30.336 A:middle
they're not going to
understand your app,

414
00:17:30.336 --> 00:17:32.776 A:middle
and they're probably going to be
discouraged by it, so go slow.

415
00:17:32.776 --> 00:17:38.796 A:middle
Use intentional moves, smooth
moves, smooth moves, you know?

416
00:17:38.956 --> 00:17:41.776 A:middle
And there's no film or anything
to load into this camera.

417
00:17:41.776 --> 00:17:45.256 A:middle
The only limitation is your hard
drive so rehearse it, retake it.

418
00:17:45.526 --> 00:17:48.576 A:middle
You know, if you flub it and
you try and continue on, don't--

419
00:17:48.576 --> 00:17:51.766 A:middle
don't-- no, no, just stop,
retake, rehearse it, retake it.

420
00:17:51.766 --> 00:17:53.206 A:middle
You got plenty of time.

421
00:17:53.206 --> 00:17:54.536 A:middle
Make it look right.

422
00:17:54.536 --> 00:17:57.846 A:middle
This is a face that's now
going on your app, you know,

423
00:17:57.846 --> 00:17:59.916 A:middle
for 30 seconds for
your customers to see.

424
00:18:00.526 --> 00:18:03.326 A:middle

you know, take some time.

like to call a one take.

432
00:18:20.956 --> 00:18:22.406 A:middle
Instead of editing
clips together,

433
00:18:22.576 --> 00:18:27.136 A:middle
they've literally taken a one
take shot at their app preview.

434
00:18:27.646 --> 00:18:29.346 A:middle

added a couple graphics

and they go

A couple tips on composition.

452
00:19:37.776 --> 00:19:40.806 A:middle
You have been developing your
app for days, weeks, months,

453
00:19:40.806 --> 00:19:42.746 A:middle
years, you know a
lot about your app.

454
00:19:43.146 --> 00:19:45.786 A:middle
Well, the customer
probably doesn't have

455
00:19:45.786 --> 00:19:47.226 A:middle
that same perspective.

456
00:19:47.556 --> 00:19:49.586 A:middle
So, when you're making
your app preview,

457
00:19:49.776 --> 00:19:50.866 A:middle
think about their perspective.

458
00:19:50.866 --> 00:19:53.496 A:middle
If you're going to barrage them
with a bunch of information

459
00:19:53.496 --> 00:19:55.676 A:middle
or assumptions about
what your app does,

460
00:19:55.886 --> 00:19:57.676 A:middle
they might be confused,
maybe put off.

461
00:19:57.676 --> 00:19:59.466 A:middle
So, think about your
customer's perspective.

462
00:19:59.846 --> 00:20:02.156 A:middle
And, you know, this is a
great, great tip is, you know,

use your friends, your family,
or everybody at your office.

464
00:20:05.506 --> 00:20:07.636 A:middle
Show your app preview
off and look

465
00:20:07.636 --> 00:20:10.196 A:middle
for what their feedback
is, you know.

466
00:20:10.546 --> 00:20:11.896 A:middle

467
00:20:11.896 --> 00:20:14.046 A:middle
to your story 'cause
you might have something

468
00:20:14.046 --> 00:20:14.936 A:middle
in your head that, you know,

469
00:20:14.936 --> 00:20:16.276 A:middle
somebody else doesn't
have in their head.

470
00:20:17.416 --> 00:20:20.276 A:middle
This is a common mistake; a
very, very common mistake.

471
00:20:20.276 --> 00:20:22.476 A:middle
If you're going to put
text up on the screen,

472

you need to put it up there long
enough for people to read it.

screen and they don't make it--

475
00:20:31.306 --> 00:20:32.976 A:middle
you know, they've-- it's
gone before you can read it.

476
00:20:33.136 --> 00:20:34.956 A:middle

throwing text up there,

477

allow people to read your text.

00:20:41.026 --> 00:20:41.996 A:middle
Stay positive.

480
00:20:42.436 --> 00:20:46.006 A:middle
There's no worst sales pitch
than a negative sales pitch.

481
00:20:46.006 --> 00:20:49.376 A:middle
This is about your app and
why your app is the best

482
00:20:49.676 --> 00:20:51.236 A:middle
or why your app is awesome.

483
00:20:51.656 --> 00:20:54.516 A:middle
So, don't imply anything
about other applications.

484
00:20:54.516 --> 00:20:56.736 A:middle
Just keep it about your
app and stay positive.

485
00:20:56.836 --> 00:20:59.566 A:middle
This is real opportunity
for your app to shine.

486
00:21:00.056 --> 00:21:03.126 A:middle
A couple more tips.

487
00:21:04.176 --> 00:21:06.026 A:middle
You may be a cross-platform
developer,

488
00:21:06.026 --> 00:21:08.726 A:middle
but for these 30 seconds,
you're all App Store.

489
00:21:09.256 --> 00:21:12.456 A:middle
So, go ahead and leave
off those platform logos.

490
00:21:12.736 --> 00:21:15.266 A:middle
In fact, leave off
the App Store logo,

491
00:21:15.266 --> 00:21:16.606 A:middle
use the 30 seconds for you.

492
00:21:17.026 --> 00:21:19.296 A:middle
We like our logo
just and-- it's fine.

493
00:21:19.666 --> 00:21:20.936 A:middle
These are your 30 seconds.

494
00:21:21.706 --> 00:21:23.036 A:middle
Leave off the platform logos.

495
00:21:23.526 --> 00:21:26.616 A:middle
You might have this great idea.

496
00:21:28.156 --> 00:21:33.286 A:middle
"New for Spring" in your app
preview, and then, you know,

497
00:21:33.286 --> 00:21:35.006 A:middle
you think you're going
to upload a new binary

498
00:21:35.006 --> 00:21:39.416 A:middle
or upload a new preview and your
cat gets sick or your car breaks

499
00:21:39.416 --> 00:21:41.766 A:middle
down and it's eight months later

500
00:21:41.866 --> 00:21:44.306 A:middle
and it's winter or
whatever season.

501
00:21:44.306 --> 00:21:46.306 A:middle
And now, it says,
"New for Spring,"

502
00:21:46.306 --> 00:21:48.586 A:middle
and it makes absolutely
no sense.

503
00:21:49.596 --> 00:21:50.816 A:middle
So, keep it timeless.

504
00:21:50.816 --> 00:21:53.236 A:middle
Allow your app preview just to
be about your app in some kind

505
00:21:53.236 --> 00:21:55.126 A:middle
of neutral time space.

506
00:21:56.506 --> 00:21:57.966 A:middle
Straightforward transitions.

507
00:21:58.206 --> 00:22:03.066 A:middle
Now I love a star wipe
or barn doors or confetti

508
00:22:03.386 --> 00:22:04.676 A:middle
as much as the next guy.

509
00:22:05.146 --> 00:22:06.346 A:middle
Remember this is about your app,

510
00:22:07.056 --> 00:22:09.396 A:middle
so straightforward transitions
are really recommended

511
00:22:09.396 --> 00:22:10.636 A:middle
when you're making
an app preview.

512
00:22:11.566 --> 00:22:14.556 A:middle
Straightforward transitions
we actually have found just

513
00:22:14.556 --> 00:22:16.826 A:middle
in our tests can actually
sometimes be confusing though.

514
00:22:17.336 --> 00:22:19.466 A:middle
Jump cuts is what we
recommend for everyone.

515
00:22:19.466 --> 00:22:21.936 A:middle
You've seen a lot of jump cuts
here and I'll show you a couple

516
00:22:21.936 --> 00:22:23.816 A:middle
of app previews that have
a lot of great jump cuts.

517
00:22:23.816 --> 00:22:27.106 A:middle
But in a couple situations, we
noticed that in jump cutting,

518
00:22:27.576 --> 00:22:29.596 A:middle
you can imply that
your app does something

519
00:22:29.596 --> 00:22:31.126 A:middle
that your app doesn't
actually do.

520
00:22:31.486 --> 00:22:33.306 A:middle
So, another great
straightforward transition is

521
00:22:33.306 --> 00:22:35.556 A:middle
like a dissolve or
a fade-through color

522
00:22:35.866 --> 00:22:40.686 A:middle
to give your user-- oh, OK,
this is a fade to another clip.

523
00:22:41.126 --> 00:22:42.236 A:middle
Make sure you don't imply

524
00:22:42.236 --> 00:22:44.126 A:middle
that your app does
something that it does not.

525
00:22:44.126 --> 00:22:45.496 A:middle
You don't want to
confuse your customers,

526
00:22:45.496 --> 00:22:46.426 A:middle
we love our customers.

527
00:22:47.156 --> 00:22:49.846 A:middle
My last point is,
remember the tone.

528
00:22:50.276 --> 00:22:53.176 A:middle
These aren't in your
face marketing videos.

529
00:22:53.176 --> 00:22:58.516 A:middle
This is just simple short app
usage videos, they're fantastic.

530
00:22:58.516 --> 00:22:59.386 A:middle
Remember the tone.

531
00:23:00.696 --> 00:23:01.026 A:middle
All right.

532
00:23:01.436 --> 00:23:03.616 A:middle
This is my things
to avoid slide,

533
00:23:03.616 --> 00:23:05.696 A:middle
I'll put my deep serious
voice on for this.

534
00:23:06.486 --> 00:23:06.796 A:middle
All right.

535
00:23:06.796 --> 00:23:07.376 A:middle
Things to avoid.

536
00:23:07.606 --> 00:23:08.696 A:middle
It's not that serious,
don't worry.

537
00:23:10.676 --> 00:23:14.726 A:middle
Blinking, crazy, flashing,
loud, obnoxious things,

538
00:23:15.026 --> 00:23:17.236 A:middle
this isn't the '90s and
these aren't banner ads.

539
00:23:19.326 --> 00:23:21.316 A:middle
If they're watching
your app preview,

540
00:23:21.316 --> 00:23:22.916 A:middle
they're already on
your product page.

541
00:23:22.916 --> 00:23:24.096 A:middle
They've already clicked Play,

542
00:23:24.096 --> 00:23:26.176 A:middle
you don't need a
gimmick to draw them in.

543
00:23:26.176 --> 00:23:27.996 A:middle
Please keep it simple.

544
00:23:28.446 --> 00:23:29.516 A:middle
You don't have to do this.

545
00:23:30.706 --> 00:23:34.136 A:middle
Pricing, if you're going to
put pricing in your video,

546
00:23:34.136 --> 00:23:34.906 A:middle
it's going to get lost,

547
00:23:34.906 --> 00:23:37.516 A:middle
it's going to put
you into the corner.

548
00:23:37.686 --> 00:23:39.766 A:middle
Remember, your app preview

549
00:23:39.766 --> 00:23:41.446 A:middle
or your app is sold
internationally.

550
00:23:41.816 --> 00:23:43.566 A:middle
You may put your
app on sale one day.

551
00:23:43.566 --> 00:23:45.576 A:middle
If you block yourself in
the pricing in your video,

552
00:23:45.576 --> 00:23:46.866 A:middle
it's not going to
make any sense.

553
00:23:46.866 --> 00:23:47.816 A:middle
Leave the pricing out.

554
00:23:48.026 --> 00:23:49.586 A:middle
These are going to display
in your product page.

555
00:23:49.586 --> 00:23:51.296 A:middle
The product page
already has pricing.

556
00:23:51.466 --> 00:23:53.306 A:middle
It already has storefront-based
pricing.

557
00:23:53.826 --> 00:23:59.846 A:middle
Leave the pricing
for the product page.

558
00:23:59.846 --> 00:24:04.176 A:middle
Local-- yeah, you know,
local colloquialisms, memes,

559
00:24:04.176 --> 00:24:06.986 A:middle
things like that,
references to Game of Thrones

560
00:24:06.986 --> 00:24:08.916 A:middle
that I don't even understand
because I don't watch the show.

561
00:24:08.916 --> 00:24:11.586 A:middle
I'm probably the
only one who doesn't.

562
00:24:11.626 --> 00:24:13.316 A:middle
But this is about
your app preview.

563
00:24:13.486 --> 00:24:17.456 A:middle
It's not about anything that's
going on in the media nowadays.

564
00:24:17.456 --> 00:24:19.526 A:middle
So, just keep it about
your app, keep it simple.

565
00:24:20.196 --> 00:24:21.486 A:middle
And here's the big one.

566
00:24:21.546 --> 00:24:24.496 A:middle
You can't put anything-- this
is just like screenshots,

567
00:24:24.496 --> 00:24:26.666 A:middle
it's just like your app,
you can't put anything

568
00:24:26.666 --> 00:24:28.976 A:middle
in your app preview that you
don't have the rights to use.

569
00:24:28.976 --> 00:24:32.406 A:middle
And this includes, but
isn't limited to, imagery

570
00:24:32.406 --> 00:24:36.466 A:middle
or photography or text or
sounds or music or videos.

571
00:24:36.756 --> 00:24:40.686 A:middle
If you don't have the rights
to use it, do not put it

572
00:24:40.686 --> 00:24:42.446 A:middle
in your app preview, all right.

573
00:24:42.446 --> 00:24:45.186 A:middle
That was as serious
as it's going to get.

574
00:24:45.386 --> 00:24:47.256 A:middle
One thing we added in
here 'cause we got a lot

575
00:24:47.256 --> 00:24:49.096 A:middle
of questions on it,
is narration.

576
00:24:50.296 --> 00:24:53.596 A:middle
Absolutely, it's a powerful
tool if used correctly.

577
00:24:54.036 --> 00:24:55.776 A:middle
So, here's a couple of tips.

578
00:24:56.736 --> 00:25:00.476 A:middle
There is an incredible
voiceover community out there.

579
00:25:00.766 --> 00:25:02.926 A:middle
Look for them, they're
so talented.

580
00:25:03.216 --> 00:25:04.556 A:middle
Use professional voices.

581
00:25:04.856 --> 00:25:08.806 A:middle
Not everyone has the intonation
and clarity for voice over work.

582
00:25:09.716 --> 00:25:11.026 A:middle
Obviously, I don't either, um.

583
00:25:12.926 --> 00:25:15.006 A:middle
But remember, this
is a voice now.

584
00:25:15.006 --> 00:25:16.296 A:middle
This is the voice of your app.

585
00:25:16.296 --> 00:25:17.596 A:middle
So, choose your voice wisely.

586
00:25:18.316 --> 00:25:21.006 A:middle
The second one is use
professional equipment.

587
00:25:21.646 --> 00:25:22.876 A:middle
It's available everywhere.

588
00:25:22.876 --> 00:25:26.296 A:middle
Condenser mics, pop filters,
just recording studios

589
00:25:26.296 --> 00:25:27.606 A:middle
in general, quiet rooms.

590
00:25:27.886 --> 00:25:31.326 A:middle
Nobody wants to listen to an app
preview with a narration on it

591
00:25:31.326 --> 00:25:33.276 A:middle
and they can hear your dog
barking at the background.

592
00:25:33.826 --> 00:25:36.986 A:middle
Or maybe for some of our younger
developers, you know, "Jenny,

593
00:25:36.986 --> 00:25:39.756 A:middle
come down to dinner," you know.

594
00:25:41.536 --> 00:25:47.556 A:middle
No, no. And lastly,
narration is a powerful tool,

595
00:25:47.556 --> 00:25:49.076 A:middle
but sometimes, it
can be overused.

596
00:25:49.076 --> 00:25:51.396 A:middle
You don't want to narrate your
entire video, but you want

597
00:25:51.396 --> 00:25:52.466 A:middle
to let your app speak.

598
00:25:52.466 --> 00:25:55.646 A:middle
So, just use narration wisely
is what I'm going to say.

599
00:25:56.836 --> 00:25:57.906 A:middle
And having said that, I want

600
00:25:57.906 --> 00:26:00.236 A:middle
to show you a really
cool app preview.

601
00:26:00.966 --> 00:26:03.406 A:middle
It's for a game called
Leos Fortune which I think,

602
00:26:03.406 --> 00:26:05.556 A:middle
they got a design
award this week?

603
00:26:05.686 --> 00:26:07.836 A:middle
Got a design award--
hey, good for them.

604
00:26:07.836 --> 00:26:08.876 A:middle
Really cool.

[ Applause ]

606
00:26:11.706 --> 00:26:13.536 A:middle
So, they have done
something really neat

607
00:26:13.536 --> 00:26:14.396 A:middle
with their narration.

608
00:26:14.696 --> 00:26:16.956 A:middle
They have their character
narrate

609
00:26:16.956 --> 00:26:18.406 A:middle
in the intro to their games.

610
00:26:18.406 --> 00:26:20.196 A:middle
So, they integrated
that narration

611
00:26:20.606 --> 00:26:22.276 A:middle
with some capture
gameplay footage.

612
00:26:22.276 --> 00:26:26.326 A:middle
So, you kind of get a picture
of the story of the game as well

613
00:26:26.326 --> 00:26:27.926 A:middle
as the gameplay all in one.

614

love to show it to you.

&gt;&gt; [Background Music] I used
to be Leopold the Golden,

616
00:26:34.016 --> 00:26:36.426 A:middle
but when my fortune
was stolen from me,

617
00:26:37.156 --> 00:26:39.656 A:middle
I was only Leopold the Fool.

618

Around me, the world
was crumbling.

619

The lands decayed.

620
00:26:45.966 --> 00:26:47.136 A:middle
Order was lost.

621
00:26:48.196 --> 00:26:51.806 A:middle
I am on a journey
with one purpose only,

622
00:26:51.806 --> 00:26:56.446 A:middle
to find my fortune
and get it back.

623

&gt;&gt; Cool, right?

624
00:27:00.686 --> 00:27:00.946 A:middle

I saw and I immediately went

and bought the game and, you
know, now I'm on like level 12

OK. So, to give you
a lot of information,

630
00:27:14.696 --> 00:27:17.106 A:middle
but really there's no better
way to get to know all this

631
00:27:17.106 --> 00:27:18.156 A:middle
than to demonstrate it.

632
00:27:18.656 --> 00:27:20.626 A:middle

demonstrate first is capture.

to bring up Mr. John Danty,

that your app outputs.

we're going to ask
you to normalize

that to a standardized

frame on the app preview.

By default, we select a poster
frame for you, but if you'd

00:41:17.826 --> 00:41:21.606 A:middle
like to choose another one,
just click Edit Poster Frame,

the video on the left

and the currently selected
poster frame on the right.

the right frame.

We wanted-- yet again, I'm
going to reiterate this--

1001
00:43:26.336 --> 00:43:28.066 A:middle
we want to show the
highest quality audio

So, we want to-- we will--
we're going to accept.

1004
00:43:32.776 --> 00:43:35.106 A:middle
And we'd like you to export out
at the highest quality of media.

1005
00:43:35.696 --> 00:43:37.846 A:middle
So, that's going to coincide

with the iOS device captures
highest quality video settings.

1007

1009
00:43:51.426 --> 00:43:56.466 A:middle

series, that's the 1136 x 640,

1010
00:43:56.686 --> 00:43:58.406 A:middle
I guess you can-- bet you can
guess what the next one is going

1011
00:43:58.406 --> 00:44:01.376 A:middle
to be, 640 x 1136.

1012
00:44:01.576 --> 00:44:04.176 A:middle
But also, we know that you
guys have some already--

1013

have already captured footage
in 1080 workflows, maybe you're

1014

in a 1080 workflow already.

1015
00:44:08.816 --> 00:44:11.106 A:middle
So, we're going to take
variance of 1080 as well

1016

1022
00:44:25.436 --> 00:44:27.056 A:middle
A couple takeaways here.

1023
00:44:27.056 --> 00:44:30.956 A:middle
We're going to take two
codecs that are very familiar

1024
00:44:30.956 --> 00:44:35.376 A:middle
to the Apple ecosystem, that's
H.264 and ProRes 422 HQ,

1025
00:44:35.376 --> 00:44:36.386 A:middle
remember, high quality.

1026
00:44:36.386 --> 00:44:37.586 A:middle
We want take the
ProRes, so you'd--

1027
00:44:37.586 --> 00:44:40.106 A:middle
highest quality video
to your customers.

1028
00:44:40.536 --> 00:44:43.036 A:middle
A couple takeaways is
the 30 frames per second.

1029
00:44:43.036 --> 00:44:45.886 A:middle
We'd like you to upload your
sources in 30 frames per second.

1030
00:44:45.886 --> 00:44:50.736 A:middle
And we're going to take stereo
audio either in AAC or PCM wave.

1031
00:44:51.786 --> 00:44:54.426 A:middle
Basic, all this documentation
will be available to you,

1032

it down, I'm sorry.

1034

be able to go over every single,

1039
00:45:14.116 --> 00:45:16.226 A:middle
applicable review
guideline to you.

1040
00:45:16.226 --> 00:45:18.696 A:middle
But, I'd like to highlight
a few that'll help find you

1041
00:45:18.696 --> 00:45:19.536 A:middle
safe passage.

1042
00:45:19.926 --> 00:45:23.626 A:middle
Remember things like
inappropriate content,

1043
00:45:23.626 --> 00:45:26.206 A:middle
trademarked items, all
apply to app previews.

1044
00:45:26.616 --> 00:45:31.146 A:middle
So, consult the app review
guidelines before uploading your

1045
00:45:31.146 --> 00:45:31.666 A:middle
app preview.

1046
00:45:32.266 --> 00:45:34.076 A:middle
First one, keep it relevant.

1047
00:45:35.316 --> 00:45:38.176 A:middle
If your app has screenshots,
or app previews

1048
00:45:38.176 --> 00:45:39.646 A:middle
that are absolutely not relevant

1049
00:45:39.646 --> 00:45:41.746 A:middle
to your app, it will
be rejected.

1050
00:45:42.136 --> 00:45:45.646 A:middle
So, don't sneak in a plug for
your Uncle Murray's car wash

1051
00:45:46.046 --> 00:45:49.886 A:middle
or a, you know, surprise
proposal to your fiancee.

1052
00:45:49.886 --> 00:45:51.256 A:middle
This is not the time.

1053
00:45:51.686 --> 00:45:52.676 A:middle
Keep it relevant to your app.

1054
00:45:52.706 --> 00:45:54.626 A:middle
By the way, she said yes
and we're married, I know.

1055
00:45:55.636 --> 00:45:57.906 A:middle
Yay, all right.

1056
00:45:58.716 --> 00:46:02.536 A:middle
Next one, just like screenshots,
you got to keep it 4+.

1057
00:46:02.966 --> 00:46:04.916 A:middle
And I know you're sitting
there maybe have a game called

1058
00:46:04.916 --> 00:46:06.206 A:middle
Mortal Kombat.

1059
00:46:06.716 --> 00:46:08.076 A:middle
And that you're like,
"Paul, do I have to make it

1060
00:46:08.076 --> 00:46:09.716 A:middle
into a tickle fest or
something like that?"

1061
00:46:09.716 --> 00:46:12.036 A:middle
No. But you're going to have
to get creative, you know,

1062
00:46:12.036 --> 00:46:14.106 A:middle
what did Spielberg do when
the shark didn't work?

1063
00:46:14.106 --> 00:46:15.356 A:middle
He made "Jaws" and
it was awesome.

1064
00:46:15.356 --> 00:46:18.666 A:middle
So, get creative, creative
editing, just, you know,

1065
00:46:18.666 --> 00:46:20.276 A:middle
leave the violence,
those things out.

1066
00:46:20.276 --> 00:46:22.836 A:middle
It has to be 4+ applicable
to all audiences just

1067
00:46:22.836 --> 00:46:25.426 A:middle
like screenshots, easy enough.

1068
00:46:26.196 --> 00:46:26.786 A:middle
All right.

1069
00:46:27.276 --> 00:46:28.566 A:middle
Use captured footage.

1070
00:46:29.686 --> 00:46:34.336 A:middle
No people in-- you know,
videos of people interacting

1071
00:46:34.336 --> 00:46:36.696 A:middle
with your apps, no
hands in the shots,

1072
00:46:36.696 --> 00:46:38.556 A:middle
so let's remove that hand.

1073
00:46:38.816 --> 00:46:39.886 A:middle
This is captured footage.

1074
00:46:39.886 --> 00:46:41.686 A:middle
You can use some
textual elements.

1075
00:46:41.936 --> 00:46:44.916 A:middle
You can use graphic elements
that highlight points.

1076
00:46:45.006 --> 00:46:47.716 A:middle
But, this is mostly about your
app and your app preview needs

1077
00:46:47.716 --> 00:46:49.886 A:middle
to be made mostly
of captured footage.

1078
00:46:49.886 --> 00:46:51.206 A:middle
And we've given you those tools.

1079
00:46:51.206 --> 00:46:52.886 A:middle
So, use captured footage.

1080
00:46:54.256 --> 00:46:57.856 A:middle
This one, simulated data please,
this goes without saying.

1081
00:46:58.136 --> 00:47:00.596 A:middle
Please don't use any
celebrities, don't use anybody,

1082
00:47:00.596 --> 00:47:02.736 A:middle
don't use your neighbor, your
friend, the person sitting next

1083

to you, anybody that
would have issue with use

1084
00:47:04.416 --> 00:47:06.906 A:middle
of their likeness
in your app preview.

Appleseeds and if you're going

1087
00:47:12.956 --> 00:47:14.846 A:middle
to use any data in
your app preview.

1088

in-app purchase content,

Time for a summary.

00:47:44.356 --> 00:47:48.726 A:middle
App previews are just 30
seconds of app usage footage.

1100
00:47:48.726 --> 00:47:53.756 A:middle
They need to be 4+ and
appropriate for all audiences.

1101
00:47:55.476 --> 00:48:01.016 A:middle
Device capture using a Lightning
cable, Mac OS X Yosemite

1102

and iOS 8 into QuickTime player.

1103
00:48:04.596 --> 00:48:07.316 A:middle
You're going to edit on
your Mac using iMovie.

1104
00:48:07.396 --> 00:48:08.506 A:middle
iMovie will be updated

1105
00:48:08.706 --> 00:48:11.906 A:middle
to support those native aspect
ratios and device dimensions.

1106
00:48:11.906 --> 00:48:13.626 A:middle
For more advanced editing,

1107
00:48:13.626 --> 00:48:16.506 A:middle
Final Cut Pro is
always a great option.

1108

with your binary reviewed.

We're going to re-encode

1112
00:48:25.906 --> 00:48:29.146 A:middle
that for streaming
all around the world.

1113
00:48:29.146 --> 00:48:32.926 A:middle

with a really cool app preview.
