[ Applause ]

2
00:00:15.046 --> 00:00:15.356 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

3
00:00:15.356 --> 00:00:15.716 A:middle
Welcome.

4
00:00:16.186 --> 00:00:17.566 A:middle
Welcome to "Intermediate Swift."

5
00:00:18.656 --> 00:00:20.666 A:middle
My name is Brian Lanier.

6
00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:22.606 A:middle
I'm an engineer in
Developer Publications.

7
00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:25.596 A:middle
Later I'll be joined on stage
by my colleague Joe Groff,

8
00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:27.836 A:middle
who is an engineer on
the Swift compiler team.

9
00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:31.786 A:middle
We're both really excited to be
here today to talk with you more

10
00:00:32.156 --> 00:00:34.316 A:middle
in depth about the Swift
programming language.

11
00:00:34.976 --> 00:00:36.676 A:middle
I've been in the labs
the last couple of days

12
00:00:36.676 --> 00:00:38.496 A:middle
and I've been very
impressed already

13
00:00:38.496 --> 00:00:40.506 A:middle
with what you've been
able to do with Swift,

14
00:00:41.156 --> 00:00:44.026 A:middle
and I think that to go
into some more detail

15
00:00:44.026 --> 00:00:46.426 A:middle
on some really key features
of Swift, you'll be able

16
00:00:46.426 --> 00:00:48.736 A:middle
to take advantage of
those features even more

17
00:00:48.736 --> 00:00:52.716 A:middle
so in your code.

18
00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:56.306 A:middle
So, in particular, we're
going to look at some features

19
00:00:56.306 --> 00:00:59.066 A:middle
in some more detail,
including optionals

20
00:00:59.246 --> 00:01:02.206 A:middle
and how you can use them
to make your code safer.

21
00:01:02.826 --> 00:01:05.245 A:middle
We're going to talk to you
about memory management in Swift

22
00:01:05.245 --> 00:01:06.856 A:middle
and how it's largely automatic.

23
00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:09.916 A:middle
We're also going to talk
about initialization

24
00:01:10.486 --> 00:01:13.386 A:middle
and how you can take advantage
of the power of closures

25
00:01:13.686 --> 00:01:15.226 A:middle
and pattern matching
in your code.

26
00:01:15.516 --> 00:01:19.406 A:middle
So, I want to begin
by looking at one

27
00:01:19.406 --> 00:01:22.666 A:middle
of Swift's most powerful
features, optionals.

28
00:01:24.096 --> 00:01:25.566 A:middle
But first I want to take a look

29
00:01:25.566 --> 00:01:27.986 A:middle
at why we might need
optionals in the first place.

30
00:01:29.686 --> 00:01:32.206 A:middle
Say you need to work with
input data from a user.

31
00:01:32.676 --> 00:01:34.586 A:middle
Here we're asking
for the user's age.

32
00:01:35.356 --> 00:01:38.406 A:middle
The response comes in as
a string, but say we need

33
00:01:38.406 --> 00:01:39.546 A:middle
to convert that string

34
00:01:39.546 --> 00:01:43.876 A:middle
to an integer using
this toInt method here.

35
00:01:44.096 --> 00:01:47.126 A:middle
Now when the user
enters a string

36
00:01:47.126 --> 00:01:48.416 A:middle
that represents a valid integer,

37
00:01:48.806 --> 00:01:53.066 A:middle
the toInt method returns the
correct result, but, however,

38
00:01:53.066 --> 00:01:56.726 A:middle
because you're not in control
of the user's response you have

39
00:01:57.276 --> 00:01:59.696 A:middle
to deal with cases or situations

40
00:01:59.696 --> 00:02:02.376 A:middle
where there's not an
obvious value to return.

41
00:02:03.346 --> 00:02:05.656 A:middle
The user has full control
over what they're entering in.

42
00:02:05.706 --> 00:02:09.936 A:middle
So, if they try to
get cute or snippy,

43
00:02:11.566 --> 00:02:15.426 A:middle
we don't really have a clear
value to return in this case.

44
00:02:15.856 --> 00:02:19.086 A:middle
So, what do we do?

45
00:02:19.086 --> 00:02:20.346 A:middle
What value do we return?

46
00:02:20.346 --> 00:02:23.686 A:middle
Well, we have lots
of options, right?

47
00:02:25.086 --> 00:02:29.766 A:middle
Well, as you're probably aware,
various sentinels have been used

48
00:02:30.306 --> 00:02:32.636 A:middle
in various different
languages to model these kinds

49
00:02:32.636 --> 00:02:35.506 A:middle
of problems, but
having so many sentinels

50
00:02:35.506 --> 00:02:37.326 A:middle
around isn't very good.

51
00:02:37.436 --> 00:02:38.636 A:middle
It's not very safe.

52
00:02:38.976 --> 00:02:41.346 A:middle
It's a common source of bugs
and problems in your code.

53
00:02:41.826 --> 00:02:42.826 A:middle
For one, you have to know

54
00:02:42.826 --> 00:02:45.396 A:middle
which of these possible
sentinels was chosen

55
00:02:45.396 --> 00:02:48.766 A:middle
by the author of the API,
and then you have to remember

56
00:02:48.766 --> 00:02:51.036 A:middle
which one to check against it.

57
00:02:52.456 --> 00:02:53.866 A:middle
So this isn't a very
good pattern.

58
00:02:54.126 --> 00:02:56.066 A:middle
So really how should
we model this?

59
00:02:57.256 --> 00:03:00.006 A:middle
Well, in Swift, we
model problems

60
00:03:00.006 --> 00:03:02.606 A:middle
like these using
the optional type.

61
00:03:03.436 --> 00:03:07.446 A:middle
The optional type represents
possibly missing values

62
00:03:07.736 --> 00:03:09.506 A:middle
of any type whatsoever.

63
00:03:10.816 --> 00:03:15.896 A:middle
The optional type has two
discrete states: a default,

64
00:03:16.536 --> 00:03:21.776 A:middle
nil state, which represents
literally the absence

65
00:03:21.776 --> 00:03:25.376 A:middle
of any value whatsoever, and
optionals are defaulted to nil.

66
00:03:25.836 --> 00:03:27.796 A:middle
You've probably seen a couple
of examples and options.

67
00:03:27.796 --> 00:03:30.646 A:middle
If you've seen the "Introduction
to Swift" talk, you write them

68
00:03:30.646 --> 00:03:33.496 A:middle
by writing the base height
followed by a question mark

69
00:03:33.546 --> 00:03:34.866 A:middle
to indicate their optionality.

70
00:03:36.116 --> 00:03:41.226 A:middle
Now, in Swift, nil is not
like Swift in Objective-C,

71
00:03:41.516 --> 00:03:44.196 A:middle
where in Objective-C Swift is
an object pointer to nothing,

72
00:03:44.456 --> 00:03:46.356 A:middle
and it only works for
the reference types.

73
00:03:47.226 --> 00:03:49.886 A:middle
In Swift, nil is a
true sentinel value.

74
00:03:50.156 --> 00:03:52.076 A:middle
It works with any
type whatsoever.

75
00:03:52.116 --> 00:03:54.836 A:middle
It literally just means
there's no value present.

76
00:03:56.266 --> 00:03:58.706 A:middle
The other state of an
option includes a presence

77
00:03:58.706 --> 00:04:01.226 A:middle
of a value that's been
wrapped up in the optional.

78
00:04:01.226 --> 00:04:04.056 A:middle
Think of optionals as this
wrapper container that wraps

79
00:04:04.056 --> 00:04:06.776 A:middle
up values when there
are values present.

80
00:04:06.776 --> 00:04:09.316 A:middle
So here we're setting the
value of optionalNumber to 6,

81
00:04:09.316 --> 00:04:12.346 A:middle
and the value is wrapped
up in the optional.

82
00:04:12.866 --> 00:04:15.366 A:middle
We'll see how to unwrap
this value and access it

83
00:04:15.886 --> 00:04:16.766 A:middle
in just a little while.

84
00:04:18.495 --> 00:04:24.706 A:middle
So, now that we have a single
sentinel value that works

85
00:04:24.706 --> 00:04:26.826 A:middle
with any type at
all, even integers,

86
00:04:27.506 --> 00:04:29.566 A:middle
it's clear what this
method should return.

87
00:04:29.566 --> 00:04:33.446 A:middle
It's clear that whenever we
have a value that's not valid,

88
00:04:33.536 --> 00:04:35.166 A:middle
we should just return an
optional, and in fact,

89
00:04:35.696 --> 00:04:37.916 A:middle
the toInt method is defined
in the standard library

90
00:04:37.986 --> 00:04:41.196 A:middle
under string type, and it does
just that, it returns nil.

91
00:04:42.066 --> 00:04:44.596 A:middle
Now because we have optionals,

92
00:04:45.066 --> 00:04:47.276 A:middle
we also have nonoptional
types as well.

93
00:04:47.276 --> 00:04:49.166 A:middle
So what are nonoptional types?

94
00:04:49.306 --> 00:04:51.846 A:middle
Well, they're just ordinary
types you would think they are.

95
00:04:52.146 --> 00:04:55.036 A:middle
Integers, strings, even
your custom objects.

96
00:04:55.396 --> 00:05:00.016 A:middle
And the great thing about
nonoptional types is

97
00:05:00.016 --> 00:05:01.706 A:middle
that they can't be nil.

98
00:05:01.706 --> 00:05:04.126 A:middle
And we think this is pretty cool

99
00:05:04.126 --> 00:05:06.606 A:middle
because this makes your
code safe and predictable.

100
00:05:06.606 --> 00:05:08.306 A:middle
When you declare a value

101
00:05:08.306 --> 00:05:11.796 A:middle
of a nonoptional
type, it can't be nil.

102
00:05:11.796 --> 00:05:13.776 A:middle
You can be sure that it's
there when you need it,

103
00:05:14.416 --> 00:05:15.506 A:middle
and you can't be surprised

104
00:05:15.506 --> 00:05:18.496 A:middle
by unexpected nil values
propagating throughout

105
00:05:19.146 --> 00:05:21.026 A:middle
your code.

106
00:05:21.216 --> 00:05:22.996 A:middle
So, now that we know
what optional types are

107
00:05:22.996 --> 00:05:25.056 A:middle
and what they represent,
let's see how we can use them

108
00:05:25.056 --> 00:05:27.856 A:middle
in our code, for example,
to write a function

109
00:05:28.596 --> 00:05:30.206 A:middle
that returns an optional type.

110
00:05:31.016 --> 00:05:33.496 A:middle
So here we're going to write a
function that looks for a string

111
00:05:34.286 --> 00:05:35.216 A:middle
in an array of strings,

112
00:05:35.216 --> 00:05:37.636 A:middle
and if that string has found
the array it simply returns the

113
00:05:37.636 --> 00:05:41.416 A:middle
index, but as you might
guess, this is a case in which

114
00:05:42.436 --> 00:05:45.216 A:middle
if the string isn't found we
need some value to indicate

115
00:05:45.216 --> 00:05:48.156 A:middle
that failure, and because
we have nil and optionals

116
00:05:48.156 --> 00:05:51.346 A:middle
at our disposal, let's go ahead
and change return pipe here

117
00:05:51.466 --> 00:05:54.336 A:middle
to an optional by adding the
question mark at the end.

118
00:05:55.326 --> 00:05:56.956 A:middle
So, let's implement
the function.

119
00:05:56.956 --> 00:05:58.856 A:middle
The first thing we need to
do is enumerate the array,

120
00:05:58.856 --> 00:06:00.626 A:middle
and here we're using
the enumerate method

121
00:06:00.626 --> 00:06:03.136 A:middle
to find the standard library,
which actually enumerates

122
00:06:03.136 --> 00:06:07.586 A:middle
to an array and returns as a
tuple, the index and the value

123
00:06:07.586 --> 00:06:09.546 A:middle
of each value in the array.

124
00:06:09.546 --> 00:06:14.086 A:middle
We can use that in the 4N
statement here and check to see

125
00:06:14.086 --> 00:06:16.216 A:middle
if the string that we're looking
for matches the value and,

126
00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:18.246 A:middle
if so, simply return
the integer.

127
00:06:18.696 --> 00:06:21.746 A:middle
Now, we're returning an integer
here, but then it gets wrapped

128
00:06:21.746 --> 00:06:24.226 A:middle
up as we said in the
optional return type.

129
00:06:24.486 --> 00:06:27.756 A:middle
And because we have nil at our
disposal, we know exactly what

130
00:06:27.756 --> 00:06:30.786 A:middle
to do when we don't
have a valid result.

131
00:06:30.916 --> 00:06:31.946 A:middle
We just simply return nil.

132
00:06:32.586 --> 00:06:36.296 A:middle
Now, as I said, we need
to unwrap optionals.

133
00:06:36.666 --> 00:06:41.986 A:middle
So, let's use this function here
to look through an array and try

134
00:06:41.986 --> 00:06:43.456 A:middle
to find a name in this array.

135
00:06:44.086 --> 00:06:47.326 A:middle
Here you can clearly see that
the string that we're looking

136
00:06:47.326 --> 00:06:50.306 A:middle
for is in the array, so we
have a valid result to return.

137
00:06:51.176 --> 00:06:52.316 A:middle
Then we can check, though.

138
00:06:52.406 --> 00:06:55.166 A:middle
We always want to check to
make sure the value is present,

139
00:06:55.166 --> 00:06:58.346 A:middle
so we can simply ask if the
index value isn't nil here -

140
00:06:59.076 --> 00:07:01.846 A:middle
and notice that I don't, I'm not
checking explicitly against nil,

141
00:07:02.236 --> 00:07:05.146 A:middle
and that's because optionals
can be used in Boolean context.

142
00:07:05.636 --> 00:07:07.166 A:middle
That means that you can
check them directly,

143
00:07:07.246 --> 00:07:08.896 A:middle
very naturally, like
I've done here.

144
00:07:09.846 --> 00:07:13.346 A:middle
So if the value is present,
which it is, we can simply try

145
00:07:13.346 --> 00:07:16.356 A:middle
to use that value in the
subscript of the array,

146
00:07:16.626 --> 00:07:19.236 A:middle
but if we've done it like
this we have a problem

147
00:07:20.056 --> 00:07:23.936 A:middle
because the array is expecting
a nonoptional integer,

148
00:07:23.936 --> 00:07:27.206 A:middle
but we've said that the function
returns an optional integer.

149
00:07:27.826 --> 00:07:29.176 A:middle
So the types don't match here

150
00:07:29.176 --> 00:07:31.016 A:middle
and the compiler will
let us know that first,

151
00:07:31.296 --> 00:07:33.476 A:middle
before we use it, we need
to unwrap the optionals.

152
00:07:34.146 --> 00:07:35.846 A:middle
One way we can unwrap optionals,

153
00:07:36.206 --> 00:07:39.236 A:middle
is using the force unwrapping
operator which simply consists

154
00:07:39.236 --> 00:07:40.306 A:middle
of an exclamation mark.

155
00:07:41.106 --> 00:07:43.886 A:middle
You write the exclamation
mark after the optional value

156
00:07:43.886 --> 00:07:44.656 A:middle
that you wish to unwrap.

157
00:07:46.176 --> 00:07:50.396 A:middle
And here because our search
returned a valid response,

158
00:07:51.066 --> 00:07:52.416 A:middle
we can simply print
out the result.

159
00:07:53.156 --> 00:07:54.246 A:middle
But you have to be careful.

160
00:07:54.246 --> 00:07:55.326 A:middle
As I said we should check

161
00:07:55.436 --> 00:07:57.756 A:middle
to make sure the value is nil
first before we unwrap it.

162
00:07:58.206 --> 00:08:00.576 A:middle
So if we try to use the forced
unwrapping operator here

163
00:08:01.056 --> 00:08:04.186 A:middle
without checking, we would
actually get a runtime

164
00:08:04.186 --> 00:08:06.606 A:middle
assertion, a runtime
error because we need

165
00:08:06.606 --> 00:08:08.866 A:middle
to make sure the value is
there, and we're trying

166
00:08:08.866 --> 00:08:11.486 A:middle
to force it when it's not.

167
00:08:11.756 --> 00:08:14.316 A:middle
So instead in Swift we have
a better way of doing this

168
00:08:14.636 --> 00:08:16.766 A:middle
where we can actually
test and unwrap

169
00:08:17.756 --> 00:08:20.506 A:middle
at the same time using what
we call optional binding.

170
00:08:21.126 --> 00:08:22.426 A:middle
Optional binding uses this

171
00:08:22.426 --> 00:08:25.036 A:middle
if let syntax you may
have seen earlier in the

172
00:08:25.036 --> 00:08:26.086 A:middle
"Introduction to Swift" talk.

173
00:08:27.476 --> 00:08:29.366 A:middle
So, the if let statement,
how does it work?

174
00:08:29.536 --> 00:08:31.986 A:middle
Well, first as I said, it tests,

175
00:08:32.236 --> 00:08:35.456 A:middle
so it tests to see the
optional type here to see

176
00:08:35.456 --> 00:08:37.686 A:middle
if it's actually present
or if its value is nil,

177
00:08:38.246 --> 00:08:41.476 A:middle
and if it's not nil,
it assigns, unwraps

178
00:08:41.535 --> 00:08:45.336 A:middle
and assigns a nonoptional
type to the index value here,

179
00:08:45.556 --> 00:08:47.006 A:middle
this temporary constant.

180
00:08:47.226 --> 00:08:49.486 A:middle
And you can use a temporary
constant because it's unwrapped

181
00:08:50.396 --> 00:08:53.466 A:middle
as the index, as a
subscript to this array,

182
00:08:54.426 --> 00:08:55.746 A:middle
and everything should
work just fine.

183
00:08:56.926 --> 00:08:58.666 A:middle
But we can actually
combine these together.

184
00:08:58.666 --> 00:09:01.416 A:middle
There's no need to actually
include a temporary variable.

185
00:09:01.656 --> 00:09:06.596 A:middle
We can simply evaluate the
result of the function directly

186
00:09:06.596 --> 00:09:08.796 A:middle
in line and then assign
that after it's unwrapped

187
00:09:08.796 --> 00:09:10.496 A:middle
to the index here,
which now index is

188
00:09:10.496 --> 00:09:14.966 A:middle
of type nonoptional Int,
just regular old Int.

189
00:09:15.866 --> 00:09:18.116 A:middle
But that's what optional
bind looks

190
00:09:18.116 --> 00:09:19.286 A:middle
like in a very simple case.

191
00:09:19.286 --> 00:09:20.406 A:middle
Let's look at how it might look

192
00:09:20.406 --> 00:09:22.506 A:middle
if we did something a
little bit more complex.

193
00:09:23.306 --> 00:09:26.296 A:middle
So, to do that, let's set
up a couple of classes.

194
00:09:26.296 --> 00:09:29.136 A:middle
Say we have a person class,
which has an optional residence,

195
00:09:30.266 --> 00:09:32.106 A:middle
and a residence which
has an optional address.

196
00:09:33.066 --> 00:09:34.636 A:middle
Finally, we have
an address class

197
00:09:34.636 --> 00:09:37.466 A:middle
that has three optional
properties: the building number,

198
00:09:37.466 --> 00:09:39.466 A:middle
a street name and
apartment number,

199
00:09:39.466 --> 00:09:40.446 A:middle
all of which are optional.

200
00:09:41.376 --> 00:09:43.386 A:middle
Let's do a little
bit more bookkeeping.

201
00:09:43.386 --> 00:09:45.916 A:middle
Let's go ahead and create a
person instance, Paul, here,

202
00:09:46.396 --> 00:09:48.806 A:middle
and let's give Paul a residence,

203
00:09:49.716 --> 00:09:52.946 A:middle
and let's also give
Paul's residence an address

204
00:09:53.126 --> 00:09:54.186 A:middle
so he can receive his mail.

205
00:09:54.426 --> 00:09:58.436 A:middle
Now because Paul doesn't live
in an apartment, we're not going

206
00:09:58.436 --> 00:10:00.006 A:middle
to set the apartment
number, but we're going

207
00:10:00.006 --> 00:10:02.586 A:middle
to set the building
number to the string 243

208
00:10:02.586 --> 00:10:04.256 A:middle
and the street name
to Main Street.

209
00:10:05.416 --> 00:10:09.516 A:middle
Now let's say that we wanted
to get at the address number

210
00:10:09.796 --> 00:10:12.076 A:middle
as an integer, not as a string.

211
00:10:12.076 --> 00:10:16.336 A:middle
Well we could use if let binding
to drill down through all

212
00:10:16.336 --> 00:10:17.726 A:middle
of these properties
and sub properties

213
00:10:17.726 --> 00:10:19.076 A:middle
of the classes we've defined.

214
00:10:19.246 --> 00:10:21.576 A:middle
So first we can test to see
if Paul has a residence.

215
00:10:21.576 --> 00:10:23.626 A:middle
If so, unwrap it,
assign it to home.

216
00:10:24.286 --> 00:10:25.626 A:middle
We can do the same
with the address,

217
00:10:26.336 --> 00:10:30.346 A:middle
and finally we can drill down
and finally use the toInt method

218
00:10:30.346 --> 00:10:33.046 A:middle
to convert that string
into a number and assign it

219
00:10:33.116 --> 00:10:36.386 A:middle
to the address variable.

220
00:10:37.556 --> 00:10:39.826 A:middle
But this is really
cumbersome, as you can tell.

221
00:10:40.106 --> 00:10:43.606 A:middle
This does not lead to pretty
code, and it's kind of hard

222
00:10:43.606 --> 00:10:46.826 A:middle
to follow all of the nested if
let syntax and statements here.

223
00:10:47.516 --> 00:10:51.796 A:middle
So in Swift we can actually
use optional chaining as a way

224
00:10:51.796 --> 00:10:53.086 A:middle
of accomplishing the same thing.

225
00:10:53.706 --> 00:10:55.586 A:middle
Optional chaining lets
you work with optionals

226
00:10:55.636 --> 00:10:57.406 A:middle
to conditionally
perform operations.

227
00:10:57.766 --> 00:11:01.086 A:middle
It's like messaging nil in
Objective-C, but in such a way

228
00:11:01.086 --> 00:11:03.036 A:middle
that it works with
any type whatsoever.

229
00:11:04.286 --> 00:11:07.876 A:middle
Optional chaining provides
a clean and succinct syntax

230
00:11:07.996 --> 00:11:09.456 A:middle
for doing these kinds
of operations.

231
00:11:09.886 --> 00:11:12.316 A:middle
So what we're doing here is
we're just evaluating each point

232
00:11:12.316 --> 00:11:15.726 A:middle
using the question mark operator
or the chaining operator to see

233
00:11:15.726 --> 00:11:18.386 A:middle
if the thing to its left,
which is of an optional type,

234
00:11:18.466 --> 00:11:20.866 A:middle
if it's nil or if it's
present before we proceed

235
00:11:20.866 --> 00:11:22.216 A:middle
to the next expression.

236
00:11:22.886 --> 00:11:25.046 A:middle
So to see how this works in
a little bit more detail,

237
00:11:25.546 --> 00:11:27.646 A:middle
let's look at this example
and see how it's evaluated.

238
00:11:27.796 --> 00:11:29.186 A:middle
You could think of
the evaluation

239
00:11:29.736 --> 00:11:31.356 A:middle
of an optional chaining
expression

240
00:11:32.016 --> 00:11:34.946 A:middle
like two parallel
railroad tracks that end

241
00:11:34.946 --> 00:11:36.916 A:middle
in two different
destinations or two stations.

242
00:11:37.196 --> 00:11:40.576 A:middle
The first station being the
optional value that's wrapped

243
00:11:40.576 --> 00:11:43.876 A:middle
up here, so in this case an Int
that's wrapped in an optional,

244
00:11:44.416 --> 00:11:46.156 A:middle
or simply nil when
there's no value present.

245
00:11:47.036 --> 00:11:48.906 A:middle
So let's see what this
looks like as we go

246
00:11:48.906 --> 00:11:49.666 A:middle
through the expression.

247
00:11:50.136 --> 00:11:51.966 A:middle
Well, Paul is nonoptional,
so that's obvious.

248
00:11:51.966 --> 00:11:53.356 A:middle
We've set him; he's
a valid instance.

249
00:11:54.116 --> 00:11:55.786 A:middle
We can go to the
first optional here

250
00:11:55.966 --> 00:11:57.836 A:middle
in the chain expression,
residence.

251
00:11:57.836 --> 00:11:59.686 A:middle
Well, we know that we've
set it as a residence,

252
00:11:59.946 --> 00:12:02.866 A:middle
but if it were nil, we would
actually just take the nil

253
00:12:02.866 --> 00:12:05.936 A:middle
track, and the entire
expression would return nil.

254
00:12:05.936 --> 00:12:08.636 A:middle
It's still of an optional type,
but it simply returns nil,

255
00:12:08.636 --> 00:12:10.426 A:middle
and the rest of the
expression is ignored.

256
00:12:11.026 --> 00:12:13.976 A:middle
But of course, we
did set a residence.

257
00:12:13.976 --> 00:12:16.206 A:middle
And we can do the same
here along the path.

258
00:12:16.926 --> 00:12:20.576 A:middle
And we can check every single
optional in a chained expression

259
00:12:20.576 --> 00:12:21.866 A:middle
to see whether or
not it's valid.

260
00:12:22.486 --> 00:12:24.466 A:middle
In this case, we've
set an address,

261
00:12:24.466 --> 00:12:28.606 A:middle
and we've set a building
number, and finally we come

262
00:12:28.606 --> 00:12:32.586 A:middle
to the last method call
after we've checked all

263
00:12:32.586 --> 00:12:33.556 A:middle
of the rest of the optionals.

264
00:12:33.946 --> 00:12:34.916 A:middle
Now the toInt method

265
00:12:34.916 --> 00:12:37.116 A:middle
as you recall returns
an optional type itself,

266
00:12:37.486 --> 00:12:39.656 A:middle
so there's actually one more
path we need to consider.

267
00:12:39.906 --> 00:12:42.496 A:middle
It could, in fact, return nil
if it can't convert the value.

268
00:12:43.926 --> 00:12:47.826 A:middle
But we've set it, of course, to
a valid string representation

269
00:12:47.826 --> 00:12:50.856 A:middle
of an integer, and so toInt
method has a result to return,

270
00:12:50.856 --> 00:12:55.406 A:middle
243, and the entire expression
is completely evaluated.

271
00:12:55.406 --> 00:12:57.676 A:middle
It's wrapped back
up in an optional

272
00:12:58.096 --> 00:13:00.526 A:middle
so that the address
number is now an optional

273
00:13:00.796 --> 00:13:02.996 A:middle
with an underlying value of 243.

274
00:13:03.756 --> 00:13:06.276 A:middle
But because it's an optional
value, if I need to use it

275
00:13:07.246 --> 00:13:09.986 A:middle
as a real integer, I
need to unwrap it still.

276
00:13:10.466 --> 00:13:12.856 A:middle
Actually we can combine
these operations together,

277
00:13:12.856 --> 00:13:17.206 A:middle
optional chaining, and if let
syntax or optional binding,

278
00:13:17.576 --> 00:13:20.226 A:middle
to test and unwrap it
at the same time again.

279
00:13:20.566 --> 00:13:23.116 A:middle
So here we can take the entire
optional chained expression,

280
00:13:23.416 --> 00:13:27.766 A:middle
evaluate it, see if it isn't
nil, unwrap it and assign it

281
00:13:27.766 --> 00:13:28.596 A:middle
to the address variable.

282
00:13:28.876 --> 00:13:30.996 A:middle
We can use it like an
ordinary nonoptional type.

283
00:13:31.446 --> 00:13:32.846 A:middle
For example, to add
it to a database.

284
00:13:34.236 --> 00:13:35.686 A:middle
So that's how optionals work.

285
00:13:36.516 --> 00:13:39.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

286
00:13:40.046 --> 00:13:40.766 A:middle
It's pretty cool.

287
00:13:41.166 --> 00:13:42.406 A:middle
So that's how optionals work.

288
00:13:42.566 --> 00:13:43.816 A:middle
It's how optional
chaining works,

289
00:13:43.816 --> 00:13:44.856 A:middle
how optional binding works.

290
00:13:45.106 --> 00:13:46.316 A:middle
I want to take a step back

291
00:13:46.806 --> 00:13:48.866 A:middle
and show you what optionals
look like under the hood.

292
00:13:49.376 --> 00:13:51.366 A:middle
I don't want to spend a lot
of time here, but I do want

293
00:13:51.366 --> 00:13:52.946 A:middle
to show you how powerful

294
00:13:52.946 --> 00:13:54.916 A:middle
and expressive the Swift
programming language is

295
00:13:55.226 --> 00:13:57.566 A:middle
that we can actually model
something so fundamental

296
00:13:57.566 --> 00:14:01.046 A:middle
to the language like optionals
in the language itself.

297
00:14:01.626 --> 00:14:04.636 A:middle
So optionals are really
just a simple enumeration,

298
00:14:05.286 --> 00:14:07.566 A:middle
a generic enumeration
at that, of any type.

299
00:14:07.876 --> 00:14:10.596 A:middle
You can see the Some type
here represents the case

300
00:14:10.596 --> 00:14:13.686 A:middle
in which I said that there is a
value present that's wrapped up.

301
00:14:13.906 --> 00:14:15.516 A:middle
You can see that
wrapping here going on.

302
00:14:15.896 --> 00:14:18.446 A:middle
And the None case just
simply is a default value,

303
00:14:18.806 --> 00:14:20.796 A:middle
which we've said that you
can indicate using nil.

304
00:14:22.126 --> 00:14:24.466 A:middle
We haven't talked too much about
generics, and we're not going

305
00:14:24.466 --> 00:14:27.176 A:middle
to go into generics in much
detail here, but I encourage you

306
00:14:27.176 --> 00:14:28.376 A:middle
to watch the "Advanced
Swift" talk,

307
00:14:28.616 --> 00:14:32.476 A:middle
where you can see the full
power of generics in action.

308
00:14:32.656 --> 00:14:33.636 A:middle
So that's optionals.

309
00:14:34.316 --> 00:14:37.186 A:middle
You use optionals to
work safely in your code

310
00:14:37.186 --> 00:14:38.756 A:middle
with possibly missing values.

311
00:14:39.706 --> 00:14:40.896 A:middle
Missing values are nil,

312
00:14:40.896 --> 00:14:43.766 A:middle
and present values are
wrapped up in the optionals.

313
00:14:44.256 --> 00:14:46.576 A:middle
You can then unwrap the
optionals in two ways:

314
00:14:46.576 --> 00:14:48.446 A:middle
either with a forced-unwrapping
operator,

315
00:14:48.716 --> 00:14:50.776 A:middle
but only do that if you're
sure there's a value there

316
00:14:50.776 --> 00:14:54.536 A:middle
and it's not nil; and you
can also use if let syntax

317
00:14:54.536 --> 00:14:56.396 A:middle
or optional binding
to unwrap and test

318
00:14:56.396 --> 00:14:58.276 A:middle
at the same time
in a very safe way.

319
00:14:59.026 --> 00:15:02.226 A:middle
And finally, you can use
optional chaining to work

320
00:15:02.226 --> 00:15:03.836 A:middle
in a very succinct
and eloquent way

321
00:15:04.196 --> 00:15:06.616 A:middle
with multiple optional
expressions chained together,

322
00:15:06.616 --> 00:15:08.336 A:middle
and that's optionals.

323
00:15:08.696 --> 00:15:11.096 A:middle
So, I'd like to invite Joe back
on the stage to talk to you

324
00:15:11.096 --> 00:15:12.386 A:middle
about memory management
in Swift.

325
00:15:13.516 --> 00:15:15.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

326
00:15:16.046 --> 00:15:16.886 A:middle
&gt;&gt; My name is Joe Groff.

327
00:15:16.936 --> 00:15:18.246 A:middle
I work on the Swift Compiler.

328
00:15:18.356 --> 00:15:21.666 A:middle
And I'm really excited because
managing memory is my favorite

329
00:15:21.666 --> 00:15:24.116 A:middle
thing to do when I program.

330
00:15:24.976 --> 00:15:26.266 A:middle
No, it's not.

331
00:15:26.956 --> 00:15:30.586 A:middle
Thankfully Swift is built on
automatic reference counting,

332
00:15:30.586 --> 00:15:33.586 A:middle
the same model we used
in Objective-C or ARC.

333
00:15:35.216 --> 00:15:38.786 A:middle
We don't make you
use pointer syntax;

334
00:15:38.786 --> 00:15:40.076 A:middle
we don't make you
spell out Alec.

335
00:15:40.116 --> 00:15:42.426 A:middle
But still we need a
clear class like this

336
00:15:42.716 --> 00:15:47.166 A:middle
and a constructed class, you get
a memory allocation implicitly,

337
00:15:47.316 --> 00:15:50.926 A:middle
and a reference to that is what
gets stored in a local variable,

338
00:15:50.926 --> 00:15:54.006 A:middle
and it's these references
that keep that memory alive.

339
00:15:55.426 --> 00:15:57.986 A:middle
Now we can juggle a couple
of these bowling pins here,

340
00:15:57.986 --> 00:16:01.306 A:middle
and when the last reference
to a class goes away,

341
00:16:01.306 --> 00:16:05.716 A:middle
an object goes away, the object
automatically gets deallocated.

342
00:16:06.386 --> 00:16:08.006 A:middle
ARC is a horrible
juggler, but it's great

343
00:16:08.006 --> 00:16:09.606 A:middle
at reclaiming unused memory.

344
00:16:10.166 --> 00:16:13.636 A:middle
When a reference
goes out of scope,

345
00:16:13.636 --> 00:16:14.946 A:middle
it's automatically released.

346
00:16:15.386 --> 00:16:17.286 A:middle
But as long as you have some
reference to the object,

347
00:16:17.286 --> 00:16:19.836 A:middle
it's kept alive, and only

348
00:16:19.836 --> 00:16:22.386 A:middle
when the final reference
is released is the

349
00:16:22.386 --> 00:16:23.576 A:middle
object deallocated.

350
00:16:23.946 --> 00:16:24.456 A:middle
It's safe.

351
00:16:24.456 --> 00:16:25.756 A:middle
It's predictable.

352
00:16:26.236 --> 00:16:27.586 A:middle
It just works.

353
00:16:28.616 --> 00:16:31.036 A:middle
Except for those cycles.

354
00:16:31.916 --> 00:16:35.146 A:middle
Sometimes it doesn't make sense
for an object to be owned.

355
00:16:35.666 --> 00:16:39.766 A:middle
For instance, apartments
literally aren't owned

356
00:16:39.766 --> 00:16:42.206 A:middle
by their tenants, but
they also will have

357
00:16:42.206 --> 00:16:43.666 A:middle
like multiple people
living in them

358
00:16:43.666 --> 00:16:45.236 A:middle
over the lifetime
of the building.

359
00:16:46.506 --> 00:16:48.806 A:middle
On the other hand, a person
will move from apartment

360
00:16:48.806 --> 00:16:50.046 A:middle
to apartment over their life.

361
00:16:50.496 --> 00:16:54.646 A:middle
Even if you move a
person into an apartment,

362
00:16:56.516 --> 00:16:59.696 A:middle
this relationship isn't
really an owning relationship.

363
00:16:59.696 --> 00:17:04.036 A:middle
And there's a problem if
we try to model it as such.

364
00:17:04.566 --> 00:17:08.715 A:middle
Let's set up a dictionary
of our renters

365
00:17:08.715 --> 00:17:10.576 A:middle
and our apartments -
say we're a landlord.

366
00:17:11.516 --> 00:17:14.675 A:middle
Let's move one of our tenants,
Elsvette, into her apartment.

367
00:17:15.486 --> 00:17:16.536 A:middle
Now there's a problem.

368
00:17:17.286 --> 00:17:20.236 A:middle
If she tries to move
out, she's trapped.

369
00:17:21.336 --> 00:17:24.376 A:middle
The reference to the apartment
keeps her object alive,

370
00:17:24.376 --> 00:17:26.215 A:middle
and even worse, if we try

371
00:17:26.215 --> 00:17:28.626 A:middle
to sell off the property
we're stuck with the deed.

372
00:17:29.546 --> 00:17:33.476 A:middle
Both objects keep each other
alive in a reference cycle.

373
00:17:35.296 --> 00:17:38.556 A:middle
So like Objective-C, we
have weak references,

374
00:17:38.966 --> 00:17:42.026 A:middle
and these tell Swift that
this object isn't responsible

375
00:17:42.026 --> 00:17:44.116 A:middle
for keeping the object
on the other end alive.

376
00:17:44.686 --> 00:17:49.736 A:middle
Now, when we work through the
example again, a weak reference

377
00:17:49.736 --> 00:17:54.366 A:middle
between these two
objects, Elsvette can move

378
00:17:54.366 --> 00:17:59.566 A:middle
out of her apartment and make a
clean break with her landlord.

379
00:18:00.146 --> 00:18:03.266 A:middle
And the reference
automatically gets reset to nil.

380
00:18:04.266 --> 00:18:07.306 A:middle
There's no dangling reference
to the allocated object.

381
00:18:08.516 --> 00:18:11.116 A:middle
Now of course, when we sell off
the property, both objects end

382
00:18:11.116 --> 00:18:12.786 A:middle
up deallocated, and
there's no leak.

383
00:18:13.226 --> 00:18:19.296 A:middle
And weak references in Swift
are modeled as optional values.

384
00:18:19.296 --> 00:18:20.946 A:middle
You can use all the
optional operations

385
00:18:20.946 --> 00:18:23.036 A:middle
that Brian just showed
you to work with them.

386
00:18:23.036 --> 00:18:26.426 A:middle
And when you take an
optional weak value

387
00:18:26.516 --> 00:18:30.076 A:middle
and you bind the
nonoptional part out of it,

388
00:18:30.206 --> 00:18:34.536 A:middle
you get a strong nonoptional
value, and you can safely work

389
00:18:34.536 --> 00:18:36.426 A:middle
with that just like
any other reference.

390
00:18:37.516 --> 00:18:39.556 A:middle
If you're applying a
single method or looking

391
00:18:39.556 --> 00:18:41.376 A:middle
at the single property
conditionally

392
00:18:41.376 --> 00:18:42.716 A:middle
on a weak reference object,

393
00:18:42.716 --> 00:18:45.796 A:middle
you can also use the chaining
operator as a nice shorthand.

394
00:18:46.336 --> 00:18:50.646 A:middle
Some things to be aware
of are that the test

395
00:18:50.646 --> 00:18:53.506 A:middle
and unwrap pattern does not
work very well with weak.

396
00:18:54.386 --> 00:18:56.086 A:middle
You could go to cash
your tenant's rent check,

397
00:18:56.086 --> 00:18:57.306 A:middle
and find out that it bounced,

398
00:18:57.816 --> 00:19:00.226 A:middle
and evict them before you have
a chance to even greet them,

399
00:19:00.226 --> 00:19:05.596 A:middle
and end up with a runtime
error you didn't expect.

400
00:19:05.716 --> 00:19:08.886 A:middle
Chaining also doesn't preserve
a strong reference if you use it

401
00:19:08.886 --> 00:19:11.806 A:middle
to try to apply multiple
methods to the same object.

402
00:19:12.296 --> 00:19:16.186 A:middle
Here cashRentCheck could
again cause the tenant

403
00:19:16.186 --> 00:19:20.146 A:middle
to get released, and then we'd
end up greeting a nil object,

404
00:19:20.656 --> 00:19:23.576 A:middle
and then, in fact, not
calling greet at all.

405
00:19:27.456 --> 00:19:29.746 A:middle
Weak references are great
for breaking cycles,

406
00:19:29.846 --> 00:19:31.696 A:middle
but they aren't always ideal.

407
00:19:32.266 --> 00:19:35.476 A:middle
Let's say we're a
modern landlord,

408
00:19:35.476 --> 00:19:37.546 A:middle
and we accept credit card
payments from our tenants.

409
00:19:37.836 --> 00:19:40.136 A:middle
A dream, I know,
but bear with me.

410
00:19:40.866 --> 00:19:44.376 A:middle
Now a credit card
should only ever be owned

411
00:19:44.376 --> 00:19:45.826 A:middle
by one person, right?

412
00:19:46.416 --> 00:19:48.846 A:middle
So we really want this to
be an immutable binding,

413
00:19:48.846 --> 00:19:51.766 A:middle
an immutable property
of the credit card.

414
00:19:52.766 --> 00:19:56.016 A:middle
We also don't even really
want to track a credit card

415
00:19:56.016 --> 00:19:57.666 A:middle
if it isn't owned by a person.

416
00:19:58.106 --> 00:19:59.766 A:middle
It shouldn't be an
optional property.

417
00:20:01.616 --> 00:20:04.686 A:middle
There's obviously a cycle here,
and we could break that cycle

418
00:20:04.686 --> 00:20:07.096 A:middle
with weak references,
but that forces us

419
00:20:07.096 --> 00:20:09.866 A:middle
into some unfortunate
loosening of the model here.

420
00:20:10.776 --> 00:20:13.196 A:middle
First of all, weak
references have to be optional

421
00:20:14.056 --> 00:20:17.136 A:middle
because they have to
be resettable to nil.

422
00:20:17.356 --> 00:20:19.706 A:middle
Second of all, they
have to be mutable

423
00:20:20.026 --> 00:20:23.406 A:middle
because they could be
reset to nil at any time.

424
00:20:24.086 --> 00:20:26.866 A:middle
And we don't really want this.

425
00:20:27.636 --> 00:20:30.376 A:middle
We could end up accidently
reassigning a credit card

426
00:20:30.776 --> 00:20:34.706 A:middle
or ending up with an
orphan credit card just

427
00:20:34.706 --> 00:20:36.876 A:middle
to deal with memory leaks.

428
00:20:37.086 --> 00:20:38.366 A:middle
That would suck.

429
00:20:39.196 --> 00:20:41.316 A:middle
So, instead, we have another
kind of weak reference,

430
00:20:41.316 --> 00:20:42.366 A:middle
the unowned reference.

431
00:20:42.846 --> 00:20:45.246 A:middle
What this tells Swift is

432
00:20:45.246 --> 00:20:48.216 A:middle
that although I don't have an
owning stake in the object,

433
00:20:48.576 --> 00:20:49.806 A:middle
my life depends on it.

434
00:20:51.036 --> 00:20:54.846 A:middle
I cannot live without my
owner, my card holder.

435
00:20:58.776 --> 00:21:00.756 A:middle
So we can go back to
our renter's table.

436
00:21:01.216 --> 00:21:03.686 A:middle
We can save our tenant's
credit card information,

437
00:21:03.686 --> 00:21:07.286 A:middle
and you can see here that the
credit card is uniquely owned

438
00:21:07.556 --> 00:21:13.536 A:middle
by the person record, so that
when her record is deallocated,

439
00:21:13.626 --> 00:21:15.806 A:middle
the entire object
graph gets deallocated.

440
00:21:16.116 --> 00:21:21.046 A:middle
There's no need to observe
the credit card independent

441
00:21:21.046 --> 00:21:21.886 A:middle
of the person.

442
00:21:22.426 --> 00:21:25.446 A:middle
And because there's
this assumption

443
00:21:25.446 --> 00:21:28.936 A:middle
that the program is not
correct without the object

444
00:21:28.936 --> 00:21:31.546 A:middle
on the other side, you can
use unknown references just

445
00:21:31.546 --> 00:21:32.636 A:middle
like strong references.

446
00:21:32.636 --> 00:21:34.636 A:middle
You can assign them
into a local variable,

447
00:21:35.066 --> 00:21:36.876 A:middle
or you can call methods
on them directly.

448
00:21:37.686 --> 00:21:39.996 A:middle
It's a bit like unsafe,
unretained in C,

449
00:21:40.106 --> 00:21:42.476 A:middle
or Objective-C, but
it's still safe.

450
00:21:42.476 --> 00:21:45.616 A:middle
We still assert that the object
is still allocated every time

451
00:21:45.616 --> 00:21:47.366 A:middle
you access it through
an unowned reference.

452
00:21:47.806 --> 00:21:52.006 A:middle
So let's look at three kinds
of references in Swift.

453
00:21:53.386 --> 00:21:54.976 A:middle
Strong references
are the default,

454
00:21:54.976 --> 00:21:57.356 A:middle
and that's because they're what
you should use most of the time.

455
00:21:57.496 --> 00:21:59.416 A:middle
Most of the time you
have an ownership stake

456
00:21:59.416 --> 00:22:03.686 A:middle
in an object you want to use.

457
00:22:03.686 --> 00:22:05.736 A:middle
However, if you have
independent objects,

458
00:22:05.736 --> 00:22:08.426 A:middle
objects with independent
lifetimes, sort of a, you know,

459
00:22:08.426 --> 00:22:10.896 A:middle
a casual relationship
going on where you can move

460
00:22:10.896 --> 00:22:14.046 A:middle
on if they went away,
weak references are great

461
00:22:14.046 --> 00:22:15.476 A:middle
for modeling that sort of thing.

462
00:22:16.006 --> 00:22:18.296 A:middle
If part of your program
ends up deallocated due

463
00:22:18.296 --> 00:22:21.796 A:middle
to maybe low memory, the rest
of your program marches on,

464
00:22:22.026 --> 00:22:23.666 A:middle
and optionals are a
great way of dealing

465
00:22:23.926 --> 00:22:25.966 A:middle
with weak referenced
objects going away.

466
00:22:26.536 --> 00:22:30.916 A:middle
And unowned references are
great for back references

467
00:22:30.916 --> 00:22:33.426 A:middle
from dependent objects
backed up to their owners.

468
00:22:34.516 --> 00:22:36.166 A:middle
If part of the object
graph goes away,

469
00:22:36.166 --> 00:22:37.996 A:middle
the entire object
graph goes away,

470
00:22:37.996 --> 00:22:39.976 A:middle
and there's no need
to deal with nil.

471
00:22:41.176 --> 00:22:42.846 A:middle
And that's memory
management with Swift.

472
00:22:43.436 --> 00:22:46.796 A:middle
It's automatic, it's automatic
reference counting, it's safe

473
00:22:47.326 --> 00:22:50.126 A:middle
and it lets you think
about the relationships

474
00:22:50.126 --> 00:22:53.096 A:middle
between your objects, rather
than the raw mechanics

475
00:22:53.096 --> 00:22:55.086 A:middle
of memory management,
making strong,

476
00:22:55.086 --> 00:22:58.846 A:middle
weak and unowned references
to model those relationships,

477
00:22:59.426 --> 00:23:02.076 A:middle
and provides a nice, safe
foundation for Swift.

478
00:23:02.076 --> 00:23:05.186 A:middle
To talk a little bit more
about that foundation,

479
00:23:05.186 --> 00:23:06.566 A:middle
I'm going to bring
it back to Brian

480
00:23:06.796 --> 00:23:08.046 A:middle
to talk about initialization.

481
00:23:09.516 --> 00:23:11.556 A:middle
[ Applause ]

482
00:23:12.056 --> 00:23:13.946 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Joe,
thank you, Joe.

483
00:23:14.116 --> 00:23:16.506 A:middle
So I want to talk to you
about initialization in Swift.

484
00:23:17.426 --> 00:23:21.446 A:middle
Initialization in Swift
follows one very simple rule,

485
00:23:21.486 --> 00:23:25.726 A:middle
and that's that every value must
be initialized before it's used.

486
00:23:27.066 --> 00:23:29.996 A:middle
This one simple rule is
enforced by the compiler,

487
00:23:29.996 --> 00:23:32.956 A:middle
and it ensures memory
safety in your code.

488
00:23:34.356 --> 00:23:37.666 A:middle
It ensures that you never read
from uninitialized memory,

489
00:23:38.066 --> 00:23:38.626 A:middle
and it, therefore,

490
00:23:38.626 --> 00:23:40.536 A:middle
helps eliminate an
entire class of bugs.

491
00:23:42.146 --> 00:23:44.756 A:middle
Let's look at how this rule
applies throughout the language.

492
00:23:44.756 --> 00:23:48.546 A:middle
So let's start with
the simple variables.

493
00:23:49.176 --> 00:23:51.896 A:middle
Swift doesn't default
initialized variables,

494
00:23:52.366 --> 00:23:56.966 A:middle
constants, or properties because
there often isn't a natural

495
00:23:56.966 --> 00:23:58.566 A:middle
and correct value
for everything.

496
00:23:59.056 --> 00:24:02.296 A:middle
The only exception to this is
optionals, where we saw earlier

497
00:24:02.296 --> 00:24:05.296 A:middle
that optionals have a very
natural default value of nil.

498
00:24:06.186 --> 00:24:09.466 A:middle
This means that you need to
set these values explicitly

499
00:24:09.466 --> 00:24:11.976 A:middle
in your code, but it
doesn't mean that you need

500
00:24:11.976 --> 00:24:14.426 A:middle
to declare these
values at the point

501
00:24:14.476 --> 00:24:17.176 A:middle
that you declare your variable
as constants or properties.

502
00:24:17.516 --> 00:24:20.276 A:middle
It just means that you must
do so before you try to read

503
00:24:20.276 --> 00:24:21.526 A:middle
from them or access them.

504
00:24:22.756 --> 00:24:26.556 A:middle
For example, say we
wanted to set message here

505
00:24:27.226 --> 00:24:30.076 A:middle
to an appropriate value
depending on whether

506
00:24:30.076 --> 00:24:33.406 A:middle
or not a condition was true and
then print that message out.

507
00:24:34.126 --> 00:24:36.566 A:middle
Even though the condition is
true in this case, I mean we're

508
00:24:36.566 --> 00:24:37.916 A:middle
in the middle of the
session after all,

509
00:24:38.626 --> 00:24:40.046 A:middle
we'd get a compiler error

510
00:24:40.546 --> 00:24:45.576 A:middle
because we haven't considered
every possible branch

511
00:24:45.626 --> 00:24:46.436 A:middle
in our code.

512
00:24:47.116 --> 00:24:49.556 A:middle
We haven't said what
the value of messages

513
00:24:49.846 --> 00:24:51.256 A:middle
when the condition is false.

514
00:24:52.546 --> 00:24:56.506 A:middle
So let's add an else
clause to do just that.

515
00:24:56.676 --> 00:24:59.206 A:middle
Now when we read for message
to print it out, we can be sure

516
00:24:59.206 --> 00:25:00.686 A:middle
that it has an explicit value

517
00:25:00.976 --> 00:25:03.126 A:middle
for every single
condition in our code.

518
00:25:03.126 --> 00:25:07.726 A:middle
But now as I'm sure you're all
aware, it's quite easy to forget

519
00:25:07.726 --> 00:25:09.896 A:middle
to check all of the
conditions in your code.

520
00:25:10.546 --> 00:25:15.206 A:middle
So rather than surprising you
by unexpected and hard to track

521
00:25:15.206 --> 00:25:19.096 A:middle
down behavior, the Swift
compiler catches these kinds

522
00:25:19.096 --> 00:25:21.786 A:middle
of mistakes for you and
ensures that you're explicit

523
00:25:21.786 --> 00:25:24.056 A:middle
about the values you want
to set for every branch

524
00:25:24.056 --> 00:25:25.796 A:middle
and under every condition
in your code.

525
00:25:26.506 --> 00:25:28.066 A:middle
This is great for memory safety.

526
00:25:28.706 --> 00:25:31.966 A:middle
Now that we've seen
how this rule applies

527
00:25:31.966 --> 00:25:34.356 A:middle
to simple variables,
let's see how it applies

528
00:25:34.806 --> 00:25:38.486 A:middle
when you're defining your
own classes like, classes

529
00:25:38.486 --> 00:25:41.736 A:middle
or structures, your own types.

530
00:25:41.916 --> 00:25:45.786 A:middle
So, inside of the structure our
class declaration initializers

531
00:25:45.786 --> 00:25:47.116 A:middle
handle this responsibility.

532
00:25:47.336 --> 00:25:49.416 A:middle
They handle the responsibility
of satisfying the rule

533
00:25:49.416 --> 00:25:52.826 A:middle
that everything is
set before it's used.

534
00:25:53.906 --> 00:25:56.876 A:middle
Now, you've seen some
initializers in some

535
00:25:56.876 --> 00:25:59.406 A:middle
of Joe's examples and memory
management just a while ago,

536
00:25:59.406 --> 00:26:01.306 A:middle
and they're declared
using the key word init,

537
00:26:02.006 --> 00:26:05.896 A:middle
and they're invoked
at object creation,

538
00:26:06.096 --> 00:26:11.736 A:middle
or instance creation here,
using this initializer syntax.

539
00:26:11.736 --> 00:26:14.466 A:middle
Now initializers can have any
number of labeled arguments

540
00:26:14.466 --> 00:26:18.756 A:middle
or parameters, and when
they do, you need to call,

541
00:26:18.756 --> 00:26:21.236 A:middle
you need to call it using
these label parameters.

542
00:26:21.236 --> 00:26:23.226 A:middle
They're required
at the call site.

543
00:26:24.356 --> 00:26:27.606 A:middle
Before we look at initialization
in classes, let's take a look

544
00:26:27.606 --> 00:26:30.416 A:middle
at initialization and how
it works in structures.

545
00:26:31.216 --> 00:26:32.766 A:middle
Let's define a simple
color structure

546
00:26:33.156 --> 00:26:35.986 A:middle
that has three properties
- red, green and blue

547
00:26:35.986 --> 00:26:37.596 A:middle
to represent the
color components -

548
00:26:37.906 --> 00:26:39.666 A:middle
and we'll deal with alpha later.

549
00:26:40.436 --> 00:26:42.626 A:middle
Now let's say that we
want to create colors

550
00:26:42.626 --> 00:26:43.736 A:middle
in different shades of gray.

551
00:26:44.696 --> 00:26:47.716 A:middle
Well to do so we can define
a single initializer here,

552
00:26:47.716 --> 00:26:50.016 A:middle
a very simple one,
that simply has,

553
00:26:50.486 --> 00:26:55.336 A:middle
takes a single grayScale
double value and sets all

554
00:26:55.336 --> 00:26:58.576 A:middle
of the stored properties of the
structure to that same value.

555
00:26:58.776 --> 00:27:01.846 A:middle
Now, if we had forgotten to set
the red property, for example,

556
00:27:02.496 --> 00:27:03.726 A:middle
we'd get a compiler error

557
00:27:03.996 --> 00:27:05.626 A:middle
because we haven't
satisfied the rule

558
00:27:05.626 --> 00:27:08.496 A:middle
that every value must be
initialized before it's used.

559
00:27:09.566 --> 00:27:11.736 A:middle
The same is true
for calling a method

560
00:27:12.316 --> 00:27:15.006 A:middle
in your initializer before you
set all of your properties.

561
00:27:16.256 --> 00:27:19.076 A:middle
For example, say we want to
validate, we want a method

562
00:27:19.076 --> 00:27:21.646 A:middle
that validates the color
components to make sure they're

563
00:27:21.646 --> 00:27:26.046 A:middle
within a valid range
of values say 0 to 1.0.

564
00:27:27.166 --> 00:27:29.826 A:middle
If we then call this
method here inside

565
00:27:29.826 --> 00:27:32.596 A:middle
of the initializer before we
set all of our properties,

566
00:27:33.296 --> 00:27:36.356 A:middle
we'd again get a compiler
error because we're trying

567
00:27:36.356 --> 00:27:38.646 A:middle
to call a method on
self on the instance,

568
00:27:39.436 --> 00:27:41.606 A:middle
but before self has
been fully initialized.

569
00:27:42.556 --> 00:27:46.126 A:middle
So if you need to access self
just customize any property

570
00:27:46.126 --> 00:27:48.926 A:middle
values or to call on the
methods in your initializer,

571
00:27:49.526 --> 00:27:52.316 A:middle
always do so after you've set
all of your stored properties

572
00:27:52.316 --> 00:27:53.336 A:middle
to appropriate values.

573
00:27:55.156 --> 00:27:57.726 A:middle
Now in structures, if
you don't define any

574
00:27:57.726 --> 00:28:00.526 A:middle
of your own initializers,
Swift provides you

575
00:28:00.526 --> 00:28:03.656 A:middle
with a memberwise
initializer automatically.

576
00:28:05.116 --> 00:28:08.276 A:middle
The memberwise initializer
has arguments that correspond

577
00:28:08.276 --> 00:28:11.556 A:middle
to each of that instances
store, each of that classes

578
00:28:11.556 --> 00:28:12.746 A:middle
or structures stored property.

579
00:28:13.636 --> 00:28:16.886 A:middle
You can also provide default
values in line directly

580
00:28:17.156 --> 00:28:19.526 A:middle
for your stored properties,
and when you've set all

581
00:28:19.526 --> 00:28:21.986 A:middle
of your stored properties
and you haven't defined any

582
00:28:21.986 --> 00:28:23.526 A:middle
of your own custom initializers,

583
00:28:24.606 --> 00:28:27.436 A:middle
Swift provides a default
initializer for you to use

584
00:28:27.626 --> 00:28:30.666 A:middle
that takes no parameters
and creates an instance

585
00:28:30.666 --> 00:28:33.516 A:middle
with the properties you
set as default values

586
00:28:34.116 --> 00:28:35.286 A:middle
when you declare your structure.

587
00:28:37.106 --> 00:28:39.376 A:middle
So that's how initialization
works in structures.

588
00:28:40.576 --> 00:28:43.936 A:middle
Now let's take a look at
how it works in classes.

589
00:28:44.106 --> 00:28:45.166 A:middle
Really it's no different.

590
00:28:46.786 --> 00:28:48.616 A:middle
So let's start with a
simple car class here

591
00:28:49.686 --> 00:28:51.996 A:middle
that has a single
property, a paint color,

592
00:28:52.326 --> 00:28:55.056 A:middle
and a single initializer that
just sets that paint color

593
00:28:55.326 --> 00:28:56.306 A:middle
to an appropriate value.

594
00:28:56.306 --> 00:28:58.876 A:middle
Now, in practice, classes

595
00:28:59.056 --> 00:29:01.336 A:middle
and often subclass
inherit from other classes.

596
00:29:01.636 --> 00:29:04.316 A:middle
So we need to deal with
how initialization works

597
00:29:04.316 --> 00:29:05.496 A:middle
with subclasses as well.

598
00:29:07.036 --> 00:29:09.506 A:middle
So let's define a
subclass called RaceCar,

599
00:29:09.546 --> 00:29:12.516 A:middle
and it has one extra property
and its own initializer.

600
00:29:13.586 --> 00:29:15.416 A:middle
When the RaceCar's
initializer is called,

601
00:29:16.206 --> 00:29:18.146 A:middle
it first sets its
own properties,

602
00:29:19.046 --> 00:29:21.606 A:middle
and then it called the
SuperClass initializer.

603
00:29:22.206 --> 00:29:26.326 A:middle
And the SuperClass
initializer, of course,

604
00:29:26.326 --> 00:29:28.946 A:middle
sets its own properties to
an appropriate value as well.

605
00:29:29.866 --> 00:29:32.686 A:middle
And only after the SuperClass
and all the SuperClasses

606
00:29:32.686 --> 00:29:35.746 A:middle
in the class hierarchy
have had a chance

607
00:29:35.746 --> 00:29:39.356 A:middle
to set their own values is
a class fully initialized

608
00:29:39.356 --> 00:29:40.326 A:middle
and ready to use.

609
00:29:41.466 --> 00:29:43.406 A:middle
Now if you're coming from
an Objective-C background,

610
00:29:44.326 --> 00:29:46.976 A:middle
you probably noticed that
this is opposite or different

611
00:29:47.346 --> 00:29:50.156 A:middle
than what you've noticed, than
what you do in Objective-C,

612
00:29:50.376 --> 00:29:53.746 A:middle
where you always call
your SuperClass first

613
00:29:53.746 --> 00:29:55.366 A:middle
and then you set
your own properties.

614
00:29:58.806 --> 00:30:00.776 A:middle
So in Swift if we
were to do this,

615
00:30:00.776 --> 00:30:02.936 A:middle
if we were to call our
SuperClass initializer first

616
00:30:03.206 --> 00:30:04.586 A:middle
and then set our own properties,

617
00:30:05.816 --> 00:30:07.346 A:middle
we would actually
get a compiler error

618
00:30:07.346 --> 00:30:10.236 A:middle
because it's not always
safe to do so in this order.

619
00:30:11.086 --> 00:30:13.846 A:middle
And the reason Swift's
initialization follows this

620
00:30:13.846 --> 00:30:18.236 A:middle
order is that it ensures memory
safety, so that you don't try

621
00:30:18.356 --> 00:30:20.556 A:middle
to access memory before it's
been completely initialized.

622
00:30:20.556 --> 00:30:24.056 A:middle
Now it may not be obvious where
you might run into problems

623
00:30:24.096 --> 00:30:26.256 A:middle
by doing things in this
order, so let's take a look

624
00:30:26.256 --> 00:30:29.176 A:middle
at an example where calling your
SuperClass initializer first

625
00:30:29.176 --> 00:30:29.846 A:middle
is unsafe.

626
00:30:31.446 --> 00:30:33.886 A:middle
Let's say, for example, that
we want to define a function

627
00:30:33.976 --> 00:30:37.146 A:middle
or method on our car class
that fills up the gas tank,

628
00:30:37.146 --> 00:30:39.766 A:middle
and we want to call that
function inside the initializer

629
00:30:39.766 --> 00:30:41.836 A:middle
so that every time we
get a new car it comes

630
00:30:41.836 --> 00:30:42.736 A:middle
with a full gas tank.

631
00:30:43.516 --> 00:30:45.696 A:middle
And because race cars use
a different kind of gas

632
00:30:45.726 --> 00:30:46.566 A:middle
than regular cars,

633
00:30:46.946 --> 00:30:49.256 A:middle
we've overridden this
method in our subclass.

634
00:30:50.396 --> 00:30:52.886 A:middle
So, when we create
a new race car,

635
00:30:53.536 --> 00:30:55.066 A:middle
and its initializer is called,

636
00:30:55.806 --> 00:30:57.896 A:middle
it first called its
SuperClass initializer,

637
00:30:58.756 --> 00:31:00.756 A:middle
which then sets its
paint color properties,

638
00:31:01.306 --> 00:31:03.476 A:middle
and finally calls its
fillGasTank method.

639
00:31:04.356 --> 00:31:06.406 A:middle
But because we've
overridden it in our subclass,

640
00:31:06.406 --> 00:31:10.146 A:middle
it gets dynamically dispatched
to the subclass's version

641
00:31:10.636 --> 00:31:13.876 A:middle
of that same method, and
that's where we have a problem.

642
00:31:15.366 --> 00:31:17.306 A:middle
And our problem is that
we haven't got a chance

643
00:31:17.306 --> 00:31:20.356 A:middle
in our own initializer to
set our own properties,

644
00:31:20.586 --> 00:31:22.886 A:middle
and so we're trying to
call a method on self.

645
00:31:23.196 --> 00:31:25.516 A:middle
We're trying to access this
object or this instance

646
00:31:25.746 --> 00:31:27.336 A:middle
that hasn't been
fully initialized,

647
00:31:27.646 --> 00:31:28.486 A:middle
and that's not safe.

648
00:31:29.926 --> 00:31:34.286 A:middle
So in Swift, we always make sure
we set our own properties before

649
00:31:34.286 --> 00:31:36.446 A:middle
we call our SuperClass's
initializer

650
00:31:36.946 --> 00:31:38.156 A:middle
to have a chance to do the same.

651
00:31:39.846 --> 00:31:43.126 A:middle
So far we've just seen
examples of a single initializer

652
00:31:43.126 --> 00:31:46.156 A:middle
in a class, but you can
have multiple initializers

653
00:31:46.156 --> 00:31:48.036 A:middle
in your class just like
you can in Objective-C.

654
00:31:48.036 --> 00:31:52.356 A:middle
In fact, you can have designated
initializers - what we've seen

655
00:31:52.356 --> 00:31:54.666 A:middle
so far - designated
initializers,

656
00:31:54.986 --> 00:31:57.026 A:middle
which you may be familiar
with coming from Objective-C,

657
00:31:57.606 --> 00:32:00.156 A:middle
have the sole responsibility
of creating an object

658
00:32:00.156 --> 00:32:01.436 A:middle
and setting all of
its properties.

659
00:32:01.926 --> 00:32:04.926 A:middle
And it has a job of calling
the SuperClass's initializer

660
00:32:05.196 --> 00:32:06.386 A:middle
and delegating up.

661
00:32:06.626 --> 00:32:08.176 A:middle
Like you can think of
them as funnel points

662
00:32:08.176 --> 00:32:10.426 A:middle
that funnel the initialization
process all the way

663
00:32:10.426 --> 00:32:12.906 A:middle
to the class, to the
BaseClass and hierarchy.

664
00:32:13.116 --> 00:32:15.456 A:middle
But you can also have
convenience initializers.

665
00:32:15.776 --> 00:32:18.966 A:middle
Convenience initializers are
sort of secondary initializers

666
00:32:19.266 --> 00:32:24.316 A:middle
that provide an alternative
implementation initialization

667
00:32:24.316 --> 00:32:28.676 A:middle
interface that allows you to
say, pass certain default values

668
00:32:28.916 --> 00:32:30.556 A:middle
and make it easier for
your clients to use.

669
00:32:30.796 --> 00:32:32.686 A:middle
They can only call across.

670
00:32:32.786 --> 00:32:36.836 A:middle
They can only delegate side
to side in a particular class.

671
00:32:36.866 --> 00:32:37.966 A:middle
They never call up.

672
00:32:38.156 --> 00:32:40.616 A:middle
So they can call designated
initializers in the same class

673
00:32:40.956 --> 00:32:42.656 A:middle
or other convenience
initializers,

674
00:32:43.046 --> 00:32:45.086 A:middle
but ultimately those
convenience initializers need

675
00:32:45.086 --> 00:32:47.716 A:middle
to call a designated to
actually do the heavy lifting

676
00:32:47.716 --> 00:32:48.786 A:middle
of setting up properties.

677
00:32:49.816 --> 00:32:52.176 A:middle
So let's see how you might
write a convenience initializer

678
00:32:52.406 --> 00:32:53.176 A:middle
in your own code.

679
00:32:53.726 --> 00:32:55.006 A:middle
Say we have RaceCar again,

680
00:32:55.086 --> 00:32:57.206 A:middle
and we want to create a
convenience initializer

681
00:32:57.206 --> 00:32:59.376 A:middle
that lets it just
pass in a color,

682
00:32:59.376 --> 00:33:01.876 A:middle
and it sets the turbo
property to true,

683
00:33:01.876 --> 00:33:04.446 A:middle
and it does so by
delegating this task

684
00:33:05.116 --> 00:33:07.356 A:middle
to the designated
initializer in the same class.

685
00:33:08.676 --> 00:33:10.846 A:middle
Now when we do this
kind of thing in Swift,

686
00:33:10.936 --> 00:33:12.756 A:middle
when we define a
convenience initializer,

687
00:33:13.026 --> 00:33:14.446 A:middle
we need to let the
Swift compiler know

688
00:33:14.746 --> 00:33:16.676 A:middle
by including the
convenience keyword

689
00:33:16.946 --> 00:33:18.116 A:middle
in front of the declaration.

690
00:33:19.236 --> 00:33:22.146 A:middle
We can even provide more than
one convenience initializer,

691
00:33:22.706 --> 00:33:25.826 A:middle
so we can even provide a
convenience initializer

692
00:33:25.826 --> 00:33:28.656 A:middle
that lets us create a RaceCar
providing no parameters at all

693
00:33:28.866 --> 00:33:30.096 A:middle
and then delegates this task,

694
00:33:31.156 --> 00:33:33.396 A:middle
here providing a
default gray value,

695
00:33:33.396 --> 00:33:36.556 A:middle
and it calls the other
convenience initializer we've

696
00:33:36.556 --> 00:33:37.176 A:middle
just declared.

697
00:33:37.176 --> 00:33:38.766 A:middle
And that in turn, of course,

698
00:33:39.066 --> 00:33:40.796 A:middle
has to call the designated
initializer

699
00:33:40.796 --> 00:33:42.086 A:middle
to actually set the values.

700
00:33:42.536 --> 00:33:44.496 A:middle
And because we have a
SuperClass to deal with here,

701
00:33:44.866 --> 00:33:46.556 A:middle
that initializer needs
to call it SuperClass.

702
00:33:47.866 --> 00:33:50.406 A:middle
And how are initializers
inherited in Swift?

703
00:33:51.186 --> 00:33:53.466 A:middle
Well, they're not
inherited by default

704
00:33:54.256 --> 00:33:55.946 A:middle
because doing so
isn't always safe.

705
00:33:57.526 --> 00:34:00.966 A:middle
However, when your class
provides no initializers at all,

706
00:34:01.476 --> 00:34:04.386 A:middle
and you set default values for
all of its stored properties

707
00:34:04.386 --> 00:34:06.336 A:middle
as we've done here with
the FormulaOne RaceCar,

708
00:34:06.336 --> 00:34:08.266 A:middle
where we've set a
single stored property

709
00:34:08.266 --> 00:34:11.045 A:middle
to a minimum regulation
weight, and since we know

710
00:34:11.045 --> 00:34:12.476 A:middle
that weight we can
set it directly.

711
00:34:12.476 --> 00:34:16.606 A:middle
Now when we do this, we actually
inherit automatically all

712
00:34:16.606 --> 00:34:18.025 A:middle
of the initializers
of the SuperClass.

713
00:34:18.025 --> 00:34:19.996 A:middle
That includes designated
initializers

714
00:34:20.266 --> 00:34:22.136 A:middle
and the convenience initializers
that we've declared.

715
00:34:22.896 --> 00:34:24.815 A:middle
Now, if we did this in
this particular case,

716
00:34:24.815 --> 00:34:26.835 A:middle
we'd have a problem because one

717
00:34:26.835 --> 00:34:29.735 A:middle
of the convenience initializers
we've inherited sets the wrong

718
00:34:29.735 --> 00:34:30.656 A:middle
value for turbo.

719
00:34:31.226 --> 00:34:34.056 A:middle
Formula One race cars aren't
allowed to have a turbo

720
00:34:34.226 --> 00:34:36.266 A:middle
by regulation, and so this
wouldn't be appropriate

721
00:34:36.266 --> 00:34:36.896 A:middle
in this case.

722
00:34:37.516 --> 00:34:39.826 A:middle
So instead we'll define
our own initializer here,

723
00:34:39.906 --> 00:34:41.916 A:middle
and now it's a designated
initializer

724
00:34:41.916 --> 00:34:43.436 A:middle
because it calls
super and passes

725
00:34:43.436 --> 00:34:44.966 A:middle
that turbo value of false.

726
00:34:46.206 --> 00:34:47.096 A:middle
And because we've done this,

727
00:34:47.096 --> 00:34:48.576 A:middle
we've provided our
own initializer,

728
00:34:49.016 --> 00:34:52.076 A:middle
we actually don't inherit those
other convenience initializers

729
00:34:52.196 --> 00:34:53.666 A:middle
or the other designated
initializer.

730
00:34:54.786 --> 00:34:58.846 A:middle
So that's how you would use
initializers to set properties,

731
00:34:58.846 --> 00:35:01.396 A:middle
and how you can set
properties in line directly.

732
00:35:02.196 --> 00:35:04.336 A:middle
But I haven't told you about a
pattern, and you may be familiar

733
00:35:04.336 --> 00:35:05.286 A:middle
with it from Objective-C,

734
00:35:05.946 --> 00:35:07.886 A:middle
sometimes called
lazy instantiation

735
00:35:07.886 --> 00:35:12.056 A:middle
or lazy initialization, where
you want to delay the evaluation

736
00:35:12.296 --> 00:35:16.156 A:middle
of a property in setting
it because, for example,

737
00:35:16.156 --> 00:35:18.786 A:middle
maybe doing so is
computationally expensive.

738
00:35:19.706 --> 00:35:23.616 A:middle
So we have the same concept in
Swift using lazy properties.

739
00:35:24.296 --> 00:35:27.336 A:middle
And let's take a
look at an example

740
00:35:27.336 --> 00:35:29.466 A:middle
of where you might use one,
where it might be appropriate.

741
00:35:29.466 --> 00:35:30.506 A:middle
Say we have a game class,

742
00:35:31.016 --> 00:35:32.806 A:middle
and the game can either
be a single player game

743
00:35:32.806 --> 00:35:33.896 A:middle
or a multiplayer game.

744
00:35:34.606 --> 00:35:38.636 A:middle
Now, the multiplayerManager,
let's just suppose

745
00:35:38.966 --> 00:35:41.326 A:middle
that it does a bunch of
expensive computation,

746
00:35:41.646 --> 00:35:43.206 A:middle
and so we don't want
to create it

747
00:35:43.956 --> 00:35:45.716 A:middle
if there's only ever
a single player.

748
00:35:46.766 --> 00:35:48.816 A:middle
We only want to create it
when there's multiple players.

749
00:35:49.476 --> 00:35:51.536 A:middle
So we want to delay
that initialization

750
00:35:51.536 --> 00:35:52.646 A:middle
until it's appropriate.

751
00:35:53.246 --> 00:35:59.356 A:middle
So we can do this in Swift by
including the @lazy attribute

752
00:35:59.356 --> 00:36:02.466 A:middle
in front of the declaration
here, and when we do this,

753
00:36:02.466 --> 00:36:06.156 A:middle
it will only be evaluated the
time it's accessed and only

754
00:36:06.156 --> 00:36:08.086 A:middle
when it's accessed and
only that one time.

755
00:36:08.636 --> 00:36:10.226 A:middle
Now just as we have
initialization

756
00:36:10.226 --> 00:36:10.966 A:middle
in Swift, we also have -

757
00:36:11.516 --> 00:36:16.716 A:middle
[ Applause ]

758
00:36:17.216 --> 00:36:18.776 A:middle
Just as we have initialization
in Swift,

759
00:36:18.776 --> 00:36:20.116 A:middle
we have deinitialization.

760
00:36:20.116 --> 00:36:22.426 A:middle
Deinitialization is responsible
for tearing down the object.

761
00:36:22.796 --> 00:36:25.916 A:middle
Now as Joe has already
told you, memory management

762
00:36:25.916 --> 00:36:28.846 A:middle
in Swift is automatic, so most
of the time you don't even need

763
00:36:28.906 --> 00:36:31.196 A:middle
to think about the
initialization - it just works,

764
00:36:31.196 --> 00:36:32.226 A:middle
it just happens for you.

765
00:36:33.446 --> 00:36:36.566 A:middle
But for cases where you
do need it, for example,

766
00:36:36.566 --> 00:36:39.756 A:middle
to unregister yourself as
an observer or, for example,

767
00:36:39.756 --> 00:36:41.686 A:middle
to close a file that
you may have opened,

768
00:36:42.306 --> 00:36:45.236 A:middle
we want to have a chance to
close that file and clean

769
00:36:45.236 --> 00:36:46.836 A:middle
up those nonmemory resources.

770
00:36:47.296 --> 00:36:50.566 A:middle
So for that we use
a deinitializer,

771
00:36:50.926 --> 00:36:53.756 A:middle
and deinitializers are just
declared using the deinit

772
00:36:53.806 --> 00:36:54.166 A:middle
key word.

773
00:36:54.456 --> 00:36:56.876 A:middle
So, for example, here we have
a class that when we open

774
00:36:56.876 --> 00:36:59.706 A:middle
up a file, if this class gets
deallocated before we have a

775
00:36:59.706 --> 00:37:02.636 A:middle
chance to close the
file, that's not good.

776
00:37:02.636 --> 00:37:06.176 A:middle
So think of this as the last
resort, the last chance you have

777
00:37:06.176 --> 00:37:08.886 A:middle
to clean up nonmemory
resources before your object

778
00:37:09.226 --> 00:37:10.176 A:middle
is deallocated.

779
00:37:11.106 --> 00:37:13.016 A:middle
Again, most of the time you
probably won't need them.

780
00:37:13.656 --> 00:37:15.076 A:middle
So that's initialization
in Swift.

781
00:37:15.316 --> 00:37:15.876 A:middle
It's safe.

782
00:37:16.696 --> 00:37:19.386 A:middle
You initialize all of your
values before you use them,

783
00:37:20.186 --> 00:37:22.216 A:middle
set your stored property
values first

784
00:37:22.806 --> 00:37:24.746 A:middle
and then call your
SuperClass initializer,

always in that order.

786
00:37:26.416 --> 00:37:28.536 A:middle
Designated initializers
only delegate up,

787
00:37:28.976 --> 00:37:31.896 A:middle
and convenience initializers
only delegate across.

788
00:37:32.816 --> 00:37:35.916 A:middle
And finally, we have the
initializers if you need them,

789
00:37:36.296 --> 00:37:37.386 A:middle
but most of the time you won't.

790
00:37:37.386 --> 00:37:39.456 A:middle
So that's initialization.

791
00:37:39.456 --> 00:37:41.586 A:middle
I'd like to invite Joe back
on the stage to talk to you

792
00:37:41.586 --> 00:37:42.576 A:middle
about closures in Swift.

794
00:37:51.326 --> 00:37:54.366 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Now, there are a lot
of ways to sort an array,

795
00:37:54.366 --> 00:37:57.686 A:middle
and we could keep our standard
library writers busy writing a

796
00:37:57.686 --> 00:38:01.356 A:middle
million different sort methods
on array, but we'd rather not.

797
00:38:01.676 --> 00:38:04.566 A:middle
So instead we have a single sort
method that takes a closure.

798
00:38:04.646 --> 00:38:06.656 A:middle
You've probably seen a bit
of this in the intro talk

799
00:38:06.656 --> 00:38:07.776 A:middle
or even in the keynotes.

800
00:38:08.766 --> 00:38:13.096 A:middle
A closure in Swift is
spelled inside curly braces.

801
00:38:13.976 --> 00:38:15.466 A:middle
You follow it with a signature.

802
00:38:15.466 --> 00:38:18.696 A:middle
In the case of sort,
it takes two arguments

803
00:38:18.696 --> 00:38:20.666 A:middle
of the element type of the
array, in this case String.

804
00:38:20.666 --> 00:38:23.396 A:middle
And in terms of Boolean, telling
us whether the elements are

805
00:38:23.396 --> 00:38:24.546 A:middle
sorted in the right order.

806
00:38:25.606 --> 00:38:26.886 A:middle
Default with the in keyword -

807
00:38:26.886 --> 00:38:30.466 A:middle
you're binding these arguments
inside the body of the closure -

808
00:38:30.926 --> 00:38:34.786 A:middle
and then you follow it with
the body of the function.

809
00:38:35.346 --> 00:38:40.406 A:middle
And now we have a single sort
method that can sort an array

810
00:38:40.406 --> 00:38:41.736 A:middle
in a number of different ways.

811
00:38:42.366 --> 00:38:45.976 A:middle
We can sort A to Z ascending,
using the lesson operator.

812
00:38:46.736 --> 00:38:49.776 A:middle
We can sort descending, using
the greater than operator.

813
00:38:50.336 --> 00:38:54.916 A:middle
We can even do something like
sort from shortest to longest

814
00:38:54.916 --> 00:38:56.876 A:middle
by counting the number of
characters in each string.

815
00:38:57.566 --> 00:39:00.656 A:middle
Now this is a great interface.

816
00:39:01.076 --> 00:39:02.636 A:middle
It's also a lot of typing.

817
00:39:03.986 --> 00:39:07.286 A:middle
And closures in this form are
a little awkward to work with.

818
00:39:07.796 --> 00:39:11.776 A:middle
And the actual interesting
part gets lost

819
00:39:11.776 --> 00:39:13.486 A:middle
in a lot of syntactic noise.

820
00:39:14.686 --> 00:39:16.976 A:middle
Thankfully we have type
inference to help us here.

821
00:39:17.286 --> 00:39:18.926 A:middle
Let's open a definition
of sorts.

822
00:39:20.216 --> 00:39:22.936 A:middle
Sort, of course, already knows
what kind of closure it takes.

823
00:39:22.936 --> 00:39:25.736 A:middle
In this case, we're working
with an array of strings

824
00:39:25.736 --> 00:39:28.056 A:middle
so it takes two strings
and returns a Bool.

825
00:39:28.056 --> 00:39:32.336 A:middle
Let's look at the
call side again,

826
00:39:32.336 --> 00:39:36.026 A:middle
and that's really offensive,

827
00:39:36.026 --> 00:39:38.306 A:middle
that's really burning
my eyes here and I want

828
00:39:39.396 --> 00:39:42.526 A:middle
to do something about that.

829
00:39:42.746 --> 00:39:43.456 A:middle
Much better.

830
00:39:44.446 --> 00:39:47.066 A:middle
We can infer the
argument and return types

831
00:39:47.376 --> 00:39:49.416 A:middle
from the signature
of the function.

832
00:39:49.966 --> 00:39:53.746 A:middle
That's a great improvement,
but we don't stop there.

833
00:39:54.176 --> 00:39:56.496 A:middle
If a closure consists of
a single return statement

834
00:39:56.496 --> 00:39:59.336 A:middle
like this, we don't
need to specify return.

835
00:39:59.746 --> 00:40:03.766 A:middle
A single expression closure
implicitly returns its results.

Thank you.

838
00:40:10.116 --> 00:40:12.996 A:middle
At this point even the
argument list is starting

839
00:40:12.996 --> 00:40:14.056 A:middle
to look a little heavy.

840
00:40:14.466 --> 00:40:15.656 A:middle
Let's get rid of
that, too [laughter].

841
00:40:17.306 --> 00:40:21.836 A:middle
There are implicit argument
names - $0, $1, $ a million.

842
00:40:22.136 --> 00:40:24.416 A:middle
They may need a little taste in
some cases, but they're there

843
00:40:24.416 --> 00:40:26.846 A:middle
if you need them and they
make closures really succinct

844
00:40:26.846 --> 00:40:29.236 A:middle
and easy to use.

845
00:40:29.406 --> 00:40:31.786 A:middle
We've also seen that we have
trailing closure syntax.

846
00:40:32.156 --> 00:40:34.106 A:middle
When you have a single
argument like this,

847
00:40:35.216 --> 00:40:36.326 A:middle
you can move it outside,

848
00:40:36.376 --> 00:40:38.266 A:middle
and when it's the only
argument you can drop the

849
00:40:38.266 --> 00:40:39.356 A:middle
parens altogether.

850
00:40:40.426 --> 00:40:42.136 A:middle
And this makes functional
programming

851
00:40:42.136 --> 00:40:44.526 A:middle
in Swift really expressive
and fun to do,

852
00:40:44.526 --> 00:40:48.356 A:middle
and we've added methods
to the array class,

853
00:40:48.576 --> 00:40:51.366 A:middle
to the array struct,
to make this possible.

854
00:40:52.116 --> 00:40:53.836 A:middle
I'll start with a
list of all the words

855
00:40:53.836 --> 00:40:56.726 A:middle
in the English language that we
got from the dictionary service.

856
00:40:57.086 --> 00:41:03.006 A:middle
Now we can pick out words
that share some common traits,

857
00:41:03.006 --> 00:41:04.806 A:middle
say the ones that end
in G-R-Y, and it turns

858
00:41:04.806 --> 00:41:07.496 A:middle
out there's only two, and
we can use the filter method

859
00:41:07.956 --> 00:41:12.476 A:middle
which selects out, which applies
a closure to each element

860
00:41:12.476 --> 00:41:14.266 A:middle
of the array and for the one

861
00:41:14.266 --> 00:41:17.936 A:middle
that it returns true returns
a new array containing those.

862
00:41:18.336 --> 00:41:23.326 A:middle
We can then transform
these with the map method,

863
00:41:23.656 --> 00:41:25.246 A:middle
which applies closure
to each element

864
00:41:25.246 --> 00:41:27.646 A:middle
and collects the results
into another array.

865
00:41:28.166 --> 00:41:31.016 A:middle
And then we can use
the reduced method

866
00:41:31.296 --> 00:41:34.246 A:middle
to fold these into
a single string.

867
00:41:37.136 --> 00:41:40.406 A:middle
Now each of these is
chaining another method call

868
00:41:40.406 --> 00:41:42.456 A:middle
onto the result of the
previous expression.

869
00:41:42.926 --> 00:41:45.686 A:middle
Even if we're using trailing
closure syntax we can just chain

870
00:41:45.686 --> 00:41:48.216 A:middle
method invocations
using dot, like this.

871
00:41:49.196 --> 00:41:50.796 A:middle
And because it's a
single expression,

872
00:41:52.286 --> 00:41:54.636 A:middle
we can even include it in
a yet larger expression

873
00:41:55.706 --> 00:41:58.276 A:middle
and include a lot
of complex logic

874
00:41:58.276 --> 00:42:00.296 A:middle
into a very small
amount of code.

875
00:42:00.976 --> 00:42:04.666 A:middle
It's an extremely expressive
way to build up your logic,

876
00:42:05.736 --> 00:42:08.806 A:middle
even for a code that
doesn't involve Hulk.

[ Applause ]

878
00:42:16.416 --> 00:42:18.366 A:middle
Closures can also
capture local states.

879
00:42:18.936 --> 00:42:23.516 A:middle
We could sum up all the elements
in array using a for loop

880
00:42:23.516 --> 00:42:27.406 A:middle
or reduce, but we can
actually abuse math to do it.

881
00:42:27.676 --> 00:42:30.196 A:middle
Inside of closure, we can
refer to local variables

882
00:42:30.196 --> 00:42:31.466 A:middle
and we can even mutate them.

883
00:42:31.466 --> 00:42:32.746 A:middle
There's never a need
to mark them

884
00:42:32.746 --> 00:42:35.636 A:middle
under under block or in any way.

885
00:42:35.636 --> 00:42:36.526 A:middle
It just works.

886
00:42:37.676 --> 00:42:43.796 A:middle
And then we can return
that result.

887
00:42:43.796 --> 00:42:46.616 A:middle
Closures are really just
literal functions in Swift.

888
00:42:47.076 --> 00:42:48.996 A:middle
Just like you can
pass a literal integer

889
00:42:48.996 --> 00:42:51.746 A:middle
or a named integer constant
as an integer parameter,

890
00:42:51.746 --> 00:42:54.666 A:middle
you can pass a closure
or, indeed,

891
00:42:54.666 --> 00:42:57.076 A:middle
a named function
as a closure value.

892
00:42:57.336 --> 00:43:00.296 A:middle
We don't have to wrap up print
line in a closure like this.

893
00:43:01.196 --> 00:43:02.426 A:middle
We can just pass print line.

894
00:43:02.426 --> 00:43:04.516 A:middle
There's only one kind of
function type in Swift.

895
00:43:05.056 --> 00:43:08.246 A:middle
We can even do this
with bound methods.

896
00:43:08.826 --> 00:43:12.516 A:middle
Instead of packing an index
set like this, wrapping a call

897
00:43:12.516 --> 00:43:13.876 A:middle
to the method in a closure,

898
00:43:14.776 --> 00:43:16.606 A:middle
we can just pass the
bound method directly

899
00:43:16.606 --> 00:43:17.626 A:middle
as a function value.

900
00:43:20.836 --> 00:43:23.206 A:middle
Closures in Swift
are just ARC objects.

901
00:43:23.206 --> 00:43:25.766 A:middle
They follow the same memory
management rules as classes.

902
00:43:25.766 --> 00:43:29.486 A:middle
So if we wanted to
have a global variable

903
00:43:29.486 --> 00:43:33.786 A:middle
that we can install a call
back on and write a function

904
00:43:34.326 --> 00:43:41.836 A:middle
that installs a call back using
local state of that function,

905
00:43:41.936 --> 00:43:44.476 A:middle
that reference will keep
that closure and all

906
00:43:44.476 --> 00:43:45.656 A:middle
of its local state alive.

907
00:43:45.656 --> 00:43:47.806 A:middle
There's never a need to
explicitly copy a closure

908
00:43:47.806 --> 00:43:50.636 A:middle
or to worry about dangling
references to its environments.

909
00:43:51.106 --> 00:43:53.976 A:middle
And just like closures
of functions,

910
00:43:54.036 --> 00:43:55.356 A:middle
functions are also closures.

911
00:43:55.356 --> 00:43:58.616 A:middle
We can nest functions inside
other functions and refer

912
00:43:58.616 --> 00:44:00.576 A:middle
to the local state of
the outer function.

913
00:44:01.116 --> 00:44:03.306 A:middle
If we look at these in the
debugger or in instruments,

914
00:44:03.306 --> 00:44:04.756 A:middle
they show up with their names.

915
00:44:05.326 --> 00:44:10.936 A:middle
So when we store a reference
to this in a global variable,

916
00:44:11.596 --> 00:44:13.586 A:middle
even when the local
function goes out of scope,

917
00:44:14.206 --> 00:44:16.256 A:middle
that reference keeps the
local function alive,

918
00:44:16.296 --> 00:44:17.196 A:middle
just like the closure.

919
00:44:17.806 --> 00:44:22.326 A:middle
Now because closures
are ARC objects,

920
00:44:22.326 --> 00:44:24.196 A:middle
they have the same ownership

921
00:44:24.196 --> 00:44:26.836 A:middle
and reference cycle
problems as classes can have.

922
00:44:27.426 --> 00:44:29.956 A:middle
If we did something
as seemingly innocent

923
00:44:29.956 --> 00:44:33.716 A:middle
as taking this call back and
putting it into the property

924
00:44:33.826 --> 00:44:37.026 A:middle
of a class, we'll
have a problem.

925
00:44:38.406 --> 00:44:41.306 A:middle
When we go to set up
these objects - of course,

926
00:44:41.476 --> 00:44:43.606 A:middle
what we're really doing
is we're capturing self,

927
00:44:43.606 --> 00:44:45.386 A:middle
and we're capturing it
as a strong reference.

928
00:44:45.826 --> 00:44:48.826 A:middle
And then when we store reference
to the closure inside the class,

929
00:44:49.546 --> 00:44:53.706 A:middle
we end up with the reference
cycle and a memory leak.

930
00:44:54.666 --> 00:44:59.156 A:middle
The compiler actually won't let
you implicitly reference self

931
00:44:59.156 --> 00:45:01.136 A:middle
inside of closure
because of this problem.

932
00:45:01.396 --> 00:45:04.816 A:middle
Yeah, it's pretty nice.

933
00:45:05.526 --> 00:45:08.346 A:middle
Now in a past life, you may
have solved this using unknown

934
00:45:08.346 --> 00:45:11.946 A:middle
reference, using a local
variable with weak ownership.

935
00:45:12.886 --> 00:45:15.696 A:middle
In Swift, we can use
unowned ownership instead,

936
00:45:16.666 --> 00:45:18.976 A:middle
but this is problematic.

937
00:45:18.976 --> 00:45:21.536 A:middle
Even if we did this, if
someone cut and pasted code

938
00:45:21.536 --> 00:45:23.426 A:middle
into this closure, it
would still be capturing

939
00:45:23.426 --> 00:45:24.366 A:middle
self strongly.

940
00:45:24.686 --> 00:45:26.356 A:middle
So we have a better
way to do it in Swift.

941
00:45:27.136 --> 00:45:29.676 A:middle
You can specify directly
inside the closure how

942
00:45:29.676 --> 00:45:31.176 A:middle

[ Applause ]

944
00:45:37.506 --> 00:45:39.086 A:middle
And now when we set
up the object graph,

945
00:45:39.136 --> 00:45:41.326 A:middle
there's no longer a
cycle, and there's no leak.

946
00:45:41.946 --> 00:45:44.716 A:middle
So that's closures in Swift.

947
00:45:44.716 --> 00:45:47.656 A:middle
They have an incredibly
expressive syntax

948
00:45:48.966 --> 00:45:51.456 A:middle
and a much simplified memory
model from Objective-C,

949
00:45:51.456 --> 00:45:53.406 A:middle
and they make functional
programming

950
00:45:53.406 --> 00:45:55.346 A:middle
in Swift really awesome
and powerful.

951
00:45:55.346 --> 00:45:59.326 A:middle
Now I'd like to talk about
another powerful feature

952
00:45:59.326 --> 00:46:01.116 A:middle
of Swift, pattern matching.

953
00:46:01.716 --> 00:46:08.136 A:middle
You may have seen in the intro
talk that Switch not only works

954
00:46:08.136 --> 00:46:11.496 A:middle
with integers, it also works
with strings or, indeed,

955
00:46:11.496 --> 00:46:15.826 A:middle
values of any type, and also
works with ranges of values,

956
00:46:15.896 --> 00:46:18.006 A:middle
but that's just the
tip of the iceberg.

957
00:46:19.156 --> 00:46:21.326 A:middle
You may also remember
that enumerations

958
00:46:21.326 --> 00:46:24.606 A:middle
in Swift can carry associated
data, and we can tell not only

959
00:46:24.606 --> 00:46:27.076 A:middle
that a train is delayed,
we can say by how much,

960
00:46:27.296 --> 00:46:29.366 A:middle
with an integer value
that only makes sense

961
00:46:30.526 --> 00:46:31.896 A:middle
when the train is delayed.

962
00:46:33.276 --> 00:46:37.516 A:middle
Because this associated data is
tied to that case of the enum,

963
00:46:38.626 --> 00:46:40.536 A:middle
we access it through
a case statement.

964
00:46:41.776 --> 00:46:43.796 A:middle
We combine it to a
variable and then use

965
00:46:43.796 --> 00:46:45.966 A:middle
that variable inside
that case statement.

966
00:46:46.246 --> 00:46:48.886 A:middle
It's electrically
scoped to that case.

967
00:46:49.406 --> 00:46:52.476 A:middle
Cases are electrical
scopes by default in Swift,

968
00:46:52.476 --> 00:46:54.316 A:middle
and we can't access
it anywhere else.

969
00:46:54.316 --> 00:46:57.276 A:middle
It's much safer and easier
than using an enum with a union

970
00:46:57.276 --> 00:46:59.076 A:middle
or struct like you
may have in C.

971
00:46:59.566 --> 00:47:03.326 A:middle
Now this is a simple
case of a pattern.

972
00:47:04.126 --> 00:47:08.906 A:middle
This outer construct
Delayed only matches values

973
00:47:08.906 --> 00:47:11.486 A:middle
of the delayed state
inside the enum.

974
00:47:12.966 --> 00:47:14.636 A:middle
And if it is at the
delayed state,

975
00:47:14.636 --> 00:47:16.856 A:middle
it unwraps the associated
data and passes it

976
00:47:16.856 --> 00:47:17.996 A:middle
down to a sub pattern.

977
00:47:18.196 --> 00:47:21.106 A:middle
In this case, the let pattern
binds it to a variable.

978
00:47:21.586 --> 00:47:25.446 A:middle
This is actually a
completely independent

979
00:47:25.446 --> 00:47:26.666 A:middle
and fully powerful pattern.

980
00:47:26.666 --> 00:47:29.226 A:middle
Anything we do at the
top level of a switch

981
00:47:29.226 --> 00:47:31.746 A:middle
with an int we can do
to its associated value.

982
00:47:32.806 --> 00:47:34.726 A:middle
So we can match it
against a specific value,

983
00:47:34.726 --> 00:47:36.256 A:middle
say we're delayed by one minute.

984
00:47:36.856 --> 00:47:39.076 A:middle
We can match it against a range
of values say we're delayed

985
00:47:39.076 --> 00:47:40.166 A:middle
from two to 10 minutes.

986
00:47:41.046 --> 00:47:42.876 A:middle
We can also ignore
the value altogether,

987
00:47:42.876 --> 00:47:45.796 A:middle
match any Delay using
the underscore,

988
00:47:45.796 --> 00:47:47.946 A:middle
which is the wild card pattern.

You can also use enums as
associated data of other enums.

991
00:47:58.796 --> 00:48:02.296 A:middle
We can track not only the status

992

of our train while
we're traveling,

993
00:48:04.616 --> 00:48:07.526 A:middle
we can track the entire state of
our vacation, and when we do so,

994
00:48:07.526 --> 00:48:08.706 A:middle
we can tell our friends

995
00:48:08.706 --> 00:48:10.526 A:middle
on social media based
on that state.

996
00:48:11.246 --> 00:48:13.056 A:middle
We can match a simple
case of the enum,

997
00:48:13.736 --> 00:48:17.196 A:middle
we can match a nested associated
value two levels deep.

998
00:48:17.296 --> 00:48:20.346 A:middle
If we're 15 minutes in, we might
be able to, 15 minutes delayed,

999

we might be a little
snarky, but still composed.

1000
00:48:23.596 --> 00:48:24.756 A:middle
If we're delayed
any more than that,

1001

we might get a little upset.

Pattern matching doesn't
just work with enumerations.

1003
00:48:32.686 --> 00:48:35.656 A:middle
It also works with the
dynamic types of classes.

Let's say we're going
to tune up a car,

1005
00:48:38.856 --> 00:48:40.106 A:middle
and it's an arbitrary car.

1006
00:48:40.766 --> 00:48:44.046 A:middle
If someone brings a Formula
One car into our mechanics,

1007
00:48:44.046 --> 00:48:48.296 A:middle
to our mechanic, he's probably
going to be a little confused.

1008
00:48:48.296 --> 00:48:49.886 A:middle
He might want to take
it to a specialist.

1009
00:48:50.786 --> 00:48:52.716 A:middle
We can do this using
the as pattern.

1010
00:48:53.276 --> 00:48:56.416 A:middle
This will both check that the
value is of a type, and if so,

1011
00:48:56.416 --> 00:48:59.516 A:middle
cast it and pass it
into the sub pattern,

1012
00:48:59.516 --> 00:49:01.406 A:middle
which we can then use
to bind a variable.

1013
00:49:01.936 --> 00:49:04.996 A:middle
And then we can pass it on to
a pit crew, who will then tune

1014
00:49:04.996 --> 00:49:06.416 A:middle
up that Formula One car.

1015
00:49:07.516 --> 00:49:10.866 A:middle
For a more mundane car,
we can pattern match it,

1016
00:49:10.866 --> 00:49:14.406 A:middle
and then if it has a turbo, tune
up the turbo before following

1017
00:49:14.456 --> 00:49:17.996 A:middle
through using the fall through
statement into the default case

1018
00:49:18.196 --> 00:49:22.986 A:middle
that does the normal
tune-up for a car.

1019

We can also pattern match
multiple values simultaneously

combining related values

like the components of a color,
and when we do so, each element

1024
00:49:39.236 --> 00:49:41.566 A:middle
of this tuple pattern is

So these are some
neat parlor tricks.

00:50:14.166 --> 00:50:16.086 A:middle
Let's try something
a little more real.

1036
00:50:16.086 --> 00:50:21.186 A:middle
Let's validate a property list,
a dictionary of arbitrary values

1037
00:50:21.186 --> 00:50:24.506 A:middle
of unknown type, and
given a valid one.

1038
00:50:24.506 --> 00:50:27.386 A:middle
we want to return a
well-typed struct.

1039
00:50:30.756 --> 00:50:35.236 A:middle
Given a property list with
a name key that's a string,

1040
00:50:35.306 --> 00:50:36.796 A:middle
a population that's a number

1041
00:50:37.056 --> 00:50:39.026 A:middle
and a two-letter
postal abbreviation,

1042
00:50:39.026 --> 00:50:42.056 A:middle
we want to get a
record like this.

1043
00:50:42.266 --> 00:50:44.756 A:middle
However, if one of the
fields is of the wrong type,

1044
00:50:44.756 --> 00:50:50.256 A:middle
or if the postal abbreviation is
too long, we want to return nil.

1045
00:50:51.126 --> 00:50:52.766 A:middle
Let's see how we can do
this with pattern matching.

1046
00:50:53.436 --> 00:50:59.466 A:middle
We'll start with a single
key of the property list.

1047
00:50:59.806 --> 00:51:05.466 A:middle
And you may remember that
optional is just an enumeration,

1048
00:51:05.466 --> 00:51:07.246 A:middle
so we can use an
enumeration pattern

1049
00:51:07.246 --> 00:51:09.936 A:middle
to both reject property
lists that don't have the key

1050
00:51:10.166 --> 00:51:14.476 A:middle
and unwrap the value
for ones that do.

1051
00:51:14.726 --> 00:51:17.906 A:middle
Inside that pattern, we
can use a type pattern

1052
00:51:17.906 --> 00:51:20.916 A:middle
to both reject property lists
that don't have a string name

1053
00:51:21.356 --> 00:51:23.796 A:middle
and get the string value
out for those that do.

1054
00:51:24.896 --> 00:51:27.856 A:middle
Then we can use a let pattern
to bind to that string value

1055
00:51:28.446 --> 00:51:29.726 A:middle
and store it to a variable

1056
00:51:30.296 --> 00:51:34.616 A:middle
with a single default clause
handle all invalid names.

1057
00:51:35.056 --> 00:51:38.726 A:middle
Now we can repeat this for
each element that we care

1058
00:51:38.726 --> 00:51:41.736 A:middle
about inside the dictionary,
but there's a better way.

1059
00:51:42.226 --> 00:51:43.816 A:middle
Remember we can use
tuple patterns

1060
00:51:43.886 --> 00:51:48.396 A:middle
to match these simultaneously
and repeat this pattern

1061
00:51:48.746 --> 00:51:52.236 A:middle
for each key of the property
list that we're interested in.

1062
00:51:52.766 --> 00:51:55.316 A:middle
We can see that the
name is a string,

1063
00:51:55.316 --> 00:51:56.566 A:middle
the population is a number

1064
00:51:56.566 --> 00:52:00.196 A:middle
and the abbreviation is a string
all simultaneously, and with the
