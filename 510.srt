1
00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:14.716 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

2
00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:18.846 A:middle
And welcome to WWDC
session on iAd Workbench.

3
00:00:20.006 --> 00:00:22.726 A:middle
I'm Paresh Rajwat and I'm
here with my colleague,

4
00:00:23.006 --> 00:00:26.616 A:middle
Ravi Chittari, to share with
you how we're evolving the iAd

5
00:00:26.616 --> 00:00:27.626 A:middle
Workbench platform.

6
00:00:28.116 --> 00:00:31.576 A:middle
We have some awesome stuff we
are bringing to you this fall,

7
00:00:32.006 --> 00:00:33.656 A:middle
and I can't wait to
share it with you.

8
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:37.996 A:middle
But before we go there, knowing
some of you are probably new

9
00:00:37.996 --> 00:00:41.406 A:middle
to advertising, and perhaps
hearing the word iAd Workbench

10
00:00:41.406 --> 00:00:42.236 A:middle
for the first time.

11
00:00:43.046 --> 00:00:45.426 A:middle
Let's start with two
foundational questions.

12
00:00:46.626 --> 00:00:47.576 A:middle
Why advertise?

13
00:00:49.196 --> 00:00:49.956 A:middle
And why iAd?

14
00:00:49.956 --> 00:00:54.136 A:middle
Let's start with the first
question: why advertise.

15
00:00:54.736 --> 00:00:59.806 A:middle
Say you developed this app, you
put a lot of time and energy

16
00:00:59.806 --> 00:01:04.426 A:middle
in it and you put
it on the App Store.

17
00:01:04.616 --> 00:01:05.966 A:middle
Now two things can happen.

18
00:01:06.856 --> 00:01:11.526 A:middle
First, users can find
your app, or second,

19
00:01:12.086 --> 00:01:14.506 A:middle
you can find users for your app.

20
00:01:15.126 --> 00:01:18.276 A:middle
Users will find your app
if they know about you,

21
00:01:19.726 --> 00:01:21.336 A:middle
or your app is featured in one

22
00:01:21.336 --> 00:01:24.726 A:middle
of the categories
in the App Store.

23
00:01:24.926 --> 00:01:27.076 A:middle
But with thousands
of apps coming

24
00:01:27.076 --> 00:01:30.586 A:middle
on the App Store every
day, natural discovery

25
00:01:30.586 --> 00:01:33.206 A:middle
of your app becomes
increasingly difficult

26
00:01:33.936 --> 00:01:35.986 A:middle
and you don't have
much control on it.

27
00:01:36.696 --> 00:01:39.136 A:middle
So what can you do
to take more control

28
00:01:39.496 --> 00:01:43.436 A:middle
of the success of your app?

29
00:01:43.666 --> 00:01:44.776 A:middle
You can advertise.

30
00:01:45.946 --> 00:01:49.036 A:middle
When you advertise, you
can find the right users

31
00:01:49.656 --> 00:01:50.716 A:middle
that will make the difference.

32
00:01:51.736 --> 00:01:56.116 A:middle
And when it comes to advertising
your apps or your products

33
00:01:56.916 --> 00:01:59.786 A:middle
to millions of Apple
costumers around the world,

34
00:02:01.116 --> 00:02:03.376 A:middle
iAd is your best choice.

35
00:02:04.756 --> 00:02:11.316 A:middle
Why? Because iAd is part of
Apple, and we know Apple users,

36
00:02:12.286 --> 00:02:14.036 A:middle
all 800 million of them.

37
00:02:15.146 --> 00:02:18.886 A:middle
We know what apps and other
items content they downloaded

38
00:02:19.606 --> 00:02:22.236 A:middle
and we know how and
when they use it.

39
00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:26.966 A:middle
Last June, we introduced
iAd Workbench.

40
00:02:27.886 --> 00:02:31.066 A:middle
It's self-service mobile
advertising platform

41
00:02:32.046 --> 00:02:36.186 A:middle
that provides you the simplest
way to promote your product

42
00:02:37.046 --> 00:02:38.846 A:middle
to millions of Apple
users around the world.

43
00:02:39.256 --> 00:02:42.496 A:middle
Since we introduced
iAd Workbench,

44
00:02:42.766 --> 00:02:44.906 A:middle
we have successfully
helped developers,

45
00:02:46.076 --> 00:02:50.056 A:middle
many of them advertising for the
very first time, drive millions

46
00:02:50.056 --> 00:02:52.706 A:middle
of visits to their
iTunes product pages.

47
00:02:54.026 --> 00:02:56.906 A:middle
iAd Workbench is
open to everyone.

48
00:02:57.986 --> 00:03:01.506 A:middle
And you can promote
anything using iAd Workbench.

49
00:03:02.516 --> 00:03:03.796 A:middle
You can promote your apps.

50
00:03:04.866 --> 00:03:08.436 A:middle
You can promote your products,
your brands, your service,

51
00:03:08.436 --> 00:03:11.256 A:middle
including your iTunes content,

52
00:03:11.646 --> 00:03:14.656 A:middle
whether it's music,
books or movies.

53
00:03:15.256 --> 00:03:19.756 A:middle
Last June when we
introduced iAd Workbench,

54
00:03:19.976 --> 00:03:22.266 A:middle
we started in the U.S.
as the first market.

55
00:03:22.266 --> 00:03:24.896 A:middle
And then a few months
after that,

56
00:03:25.416 --> 00:03:26.886 A:middle
we expanded internationally.

57
00:03:27.556 --> 00:03:31.136 A:middle
iAd Workbench is now
available in 14 countries

58
00:03:32.046 --> 00:03:33.116 A:middle
and expanding rapidly.

59
00:03:33.686 --> 00:03:37.986 A:middle
Now creating a campaign using
iAd Workbench is very easy.

60
00:03:39.386 --> 00:03:41.536 A:middle
You can create one in
just a few minutes.

61
00:03:42.856 --> 00:03:48.036 A:middle
To demonstrate, why don't I have
Ravi show you how easy it is

62
00:03:48.036 --> 00:03:49.446 A:middle
to advertise using
iAd Workbench.

63
00:03:50.396 --> 00:03:51.256 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Paresh.

64
00:03:52.456 --> 00:03:53.256 A:middle
Good morning everyone.

65
00:03:54.066 --> 00:03:56.206 A:middle
I'm Ravi Chittari from
iAd Engineering team.

66
00:03:56.736 --> 00:03:58.566 A:middle
I'm here to demo iAd Workbench.

67
00:03:58.996 --> 00:04:06.256 A:middle
In this demo, you will see how
easy it is to promote an app.

68
00:04:06.506 --> 00:04:10.656 A:middle
During this demo, you will see
several options, but I'm going

69
00:04:10.656 --> 00:04:13.196 A:middle
to focus on a few and
will cover more later.

70
00:04:14.306 --> 00:04:15.786 A:middle
Let's get started.

71
00:04:17.546 --> 00:04:21.666 A:middle
iAd Workbench is accessible
through iadworkbench.apple.com.

72
00:04:22.406 --> 00:04:25.846 A:middle
All you need is an
Apple ID to log in.

73
00:04:26.116 --> 00:04:30.026 A:middle
When you log in, the first page
you go to is the Dashboard.

74
00:04:30.996 --> 00:04:32.926 A:middle
Dashboard is a summary
of all the campaigns,

75
00:04:33.896 --> 00:04:35.266 A:middle
and also it gives basic metrics.

76
00:04:35.896 --> 00:04:38.156 A:middle
To get into the campaign
creation flow,

77
00:04:38.636 --> 00:04:39.916 A:middle
let's click on Create Campaign.

78
00:04:44.836 --> 00:04:47.486 A:middle
The first choice you have is
what do you want to promote?

79
00:04:48.896 --> 00:04:50.316 A:middle
App or a Product?

80
00:04:52.076 --> 00:04:55.096 A:middle
Let's select App.

81
00:04:55.346 --> 00:04:59.256 A:middle
Below are the three apps that
are published to the App Store

82
00:04:59.606 --> 00:05:01.846 A:middle
from my developer account.

83
00:05:01.846 --> 00:05:05.416 A:middle
iAd Workbench automatically gets
all the apps that you published

84
00:05:05.416 --> 00:05:07.786 A:middle
to the App Store and
makes it available here

85
00:05:08.606 --> 00:05:11.666 A:middle
so you can promote
through campaigns.

86
00:05:12.176 --> 00:05:13.716 A:middle
Let me select Klara.

87
00:05:13.716 --> 00:05:19.896 A:middle
For a bid type, my goal
is to drive downloads.

88
00:05:19.986 --> 00:05:22.786 A:middle
I'm going to select
CPC, cost per click.

89
00:05:23.246 --> 00:05:26.506 A:middle
Let me name my campaign.

90
00:05:34.136 --> 00:05:37.966 A:middle
Clicking on Next will take
me to step 2, Targeting.

91
00:05:38.826 --> 00:05:40.936 A:middle
Targeting is all about
finding the right audience

92
00:05:40.936 --> 00:05:41.546 A:middle
for your campaign.

93
00:05:41.546 --> 00:05:44.746 A:middle
We have two options,
Auto and Manual.

94
00:05:45.766 --> 00:05:49.166 A:middle
In case of Auto, iAd finds
the right audience for you.

95
00:05:49.716 --> 00:05:52.786 A:middle
In case of Manual, you get to
set the targeting preferences.

96
00:05:53.226 --> 00:05:55.956 A:middle
Let me set up Auto.

97
00:05:56.176 --> 00:05:57.986 A:middle
Next, country where
your ad is going to run.

98
00:05:58.176 --> 00:06:00.066 A:middle
I'm going to select
United States.

99
00:06:01.466 --> 00:06:05.286 A:middle
Next, Ad. Ad is a combination
of Creative and Destination.

100
00:06:05.876 --> 00:06:08.456 A:middle
I'm going to select
Banner for Creative

101
00:06:09.126 --> 00:06:10.366 A:middle
and Destination: iTunes.

102
00:06:11.676 --> 00:06:15.136 A:middle
iTunes destination refers to
the App Store product page

103
00:06:15.806 --> 00:06:18.796 A:middle
where user can review
the app details

104
00:06:18.796 --> 00:06:22.176 A:middle
and download the app
right from there.

105
00:06:22.306 --> 00:06:23.116 A:middle
Next, flight dates.

106
00:06:24.586 --> 00:06:26.646 A:middle
These are the dates during which
your campaign is going to run.

107
00:06:27.556 --> 00:06:30.446 A:middle
The default started is today
and ended is a month from now.

108
00:06:30.976 --> 00:06:32.806 A:middle
Let's leave it as is.

109
00:06:33.186 --> 00:06:33.826 A:middle
Next, budget.

110
00:06:33.826 --> 00:06:36.166 A:middle
How much money you are willing
to spend on this campaign?

111
00:06:36.166 --> 00:06:38.406 A:middle
Let me enter 2,000 dollars.

112
00:06:40.096 --> 00:06:41.996 A:middle
Daily Spend Goal is
automatically calculated.

113
00:06:43.786 --> 00:06:47.916 A:middle
CPC Bid: how much you are
willing to pay per click,

114
00:06:48.826 --> 00:06:50.506 A:middle
the maximum you're
willing to pay per click.

115
00:06:50.696 --> 00:06:54.546 A:middle
You may enter 50 cents.

116
00:06:54.596 --> 00:06:56.456 A:middle
Let's leave the CPA
Goal optional.

117
00:06:57.646 --> 00:07:01.496 A:middle
Clicking on Calculate will
give us the estimated number

118
00:07:01.496 --> 00:07:04.726 A:middle
of impressions and tabs.

119
00:07:04.726 --> 00:07:08.516 A:middle
If you want to see more
impressions and tabs,

120
00:07:08.636 --> 00:07:11.526 A:middle
you can change the combination
of targeting, budget,

121
00:07:11.526 --> 00:07:17.056 A:middle
and bid, and you'll see more.

122
00:07:17.256 --> 00:07:18.586 A:middle
Next, let's name our line.

123
00:07:19.186 --> 00:07:21.876 A:middle
I've used the term "line"
several times in this page.

124
00:07:22.706 --> 00:07:23.216 A:middle
What is line?

125
00:07:23.926 --> 00:07:27.576 A:middle
A line is a combination of
targeting, budget, and bid.

126
00:07:27.796 --> 00:07:29.626 A:middle
You can have several
lines in a campaign.

127
00:07:30.616 --> 00:07:34.626 A:middle
I'm going to name this
line, My Simple Auto Line.

128
00:07:36.076 --> 00:07:39.756 A:middle
Clicking on Next will take me
to the Targeting Summary page

129
00:07:40.566 --> 00:07:41.856 A:middle
where all the lines are listed.

130
00:07:42.356 --> 00:07:44.436 A:middle
For this campaign, we
have just one line.

131
00:07:45.136 --> 00:07:47.626 A:middle
You can always add more lines by
clicking on Create Line button.

132
00:07:48.836 --> 00:07:54.226 A:middle
Clicking on Next will take us to
step 3, which is Creating an Ad.

133
00:07:55.336 --> 00:07:57.846 A:middle
The first choice we have
is selecting a device

134
00:07:57.846 --> 00:07:58.876 A:middle
where your ad is going to run.

135
00:07:59.606 --> 00:08:02.726 A:middle
Klara is a universal app,
so the system detected that

136
00:08:02.726 --> 00:08:05.136 A:middle
and gave iPhone,
iPad on Universal.

137
00:08:05.626 --> 00:08:06.556 A:middle
Let's select Universal.

138
00:08:07.716 --> 00:08:09.286 A:middle
For language, let's
stick with English.

139
00:08:09.696 --> 00:08:10.916 A:middle
We have more choices
there as well.

140
00:08:12.006 --> 00:08:13.796 A:middle
Then let's define the creative.

141
00:08:14.276 --> 00:08:18.166 A:middle
There are two choices, Using a
Template and From My Desktop.

142
00:08:18.966 --> 00:08:23.966 A:middle
From My Desktop is
upload your own Banner.

143
00:08:25.396 --> 00:08:27.366 A:middle
But for now, let's
select templates.

144
00:08:27.366 --> 00:08:31.276 A:middle
We have built several templates
for you to make it easy.

145
00:08:32.196 --> 00:08:36.666 A:middle
As you can see, there
are different formats

146
00:08:36.666 --> 00:08:37.466 A:middle
for these templates.

147
00:08:38.546 --> 00:08:39.476 A:middle
Let me select marigold.

148
00:08:42.126 --> 00:08:46.106 A:middle
For title, let's give
the name of the app.

149
00:08:47.046 --> 00:08:50.106 A:middle
And for message, few
words about your app.

150
00:08:52.956 --> 00:08:56.776 A:middle
And for Call to Action, you
have several predefined ones

151
00:08:56.946 --> 00:08:58.626 A:middle
or you can always
enter a custom text.

152
00:08:59.366 --> 00:09:00.486 A:middle
I'm going to select
Download Now.

153
00:09:00.776 --> 00:09:06.526 A:middle
And here is the preview of
how your Banner is going

154
00:09:06.526 --> 00:09:07.306 A:middle
to look on the device.

155
00:09:08.556 --> 00:09:10.106 A:middle
You can click on View All Sizes

156
00:09:10.746 --> 00:09:14.126 A:middle
to see how we have prepared
this creative for iPhone, iPad,

157
00:09:14.196 --> 00:09:15.056 A:middle
portrait and landscape.

158
00:09:18.896 --> 00:09:19.956 A:middle
That's how simple it is.

159
00:09:21.386 --> 00:09:23.056 A:middle
Let's select their
destination, iTunes.

160
00:09:23.056 --> 00:09:29.006 A:middle
As you saw, as soon as I
selected the destination,

161
00:09:30.196 --> 00:09:34.886 A:middle
it's pointing to the
Klara iTunes product page.

162
00:09:34.986 --> 00:09:38.056 A:middle
For this ad to go live,
we need to associate this

163
00:09:38.056 --> 00:09:40.316 A:middle
with the line that
we just created.

164
00:09:43.886 --> 00:09:45.056 A:middle
I'm assigning to the line.

165
00:09:46.116 --> 00:09:52.476 A:middle
We give that name, Marigold 1.

166
00:09:52.666 --> 00:09:55.686 A:middle
Clicking on Next will take
us to the Ad Summary page

167
00:09:56.316 --> 00:09:57.436 A:middle
where you will see all the ads

168
00:09:57.476 --> 00:09:58.806 A:middle
that are created
for this campaign.

169
00:10:01.526 --> 00:10:03.926 A:middle
And you can always
create more Ads from here

170
00:10:04.496 --> 00:10:05.566 A:middle
by clicking on Create Ad.

171
00:10:06.546 --> 00:10:09.066 A:middle
Clicking on Next will take us
to the Campaign Summary page

172
00:10:09.066 --> 00:10:12.946 A:middle
where you can review all
the details in one place.

173
00:10:13.136 --> 00:10:13.896 A:middle
Where you're promoting,

174
00:10:14.566 --> 00:10:16.946 A:middle
what you're targeting,
what are your ads.

175
00:10:18.216 --> 00:10:20.856 A:middle
In case you have not
set up the payment yet,

176
00:10:21.806 --> 00:10:24.636 A:middle
which is a credit card,
you can always click here,

177
00:10:24.636 --> 00:10:25.816 A:middle
but let's Submit.

178
00:10:25.816 --> 00:10:32.236 A:middle
When you submit, the
creatives are submitted

179
00:10:32.236 --> 00:10:33.966 A:middle
for iAd's Certification review.

180
00:10:34.886 --> 00:10:36.976 A:middle
Once they are approved,
your campaign goes live.

181
00:10:38.716 --> 00:10:39.746 A:middle
That's how simple it is.

182
00:10:40.926 --> 00:10:42.086 A:middle
Back to you, Paresh.

183
00:10:42.816 --> 00:10:47.686 A:middle
&gt;&gt; So next, let's take a deeper
dive at the tools, options,

184
00:10:47.686 --> 00:10:49.676 A:middle
controls, flexibility you have

185
00:10:50.146 --> 00:10:53.596 A:middle
in making advertising
work using iAd Workbench.

186
00:10:53.976 --> 00:11:02.526 A:middle
We'll look at the choices you
have in choosing your audience,

187
00:11:03.156 --> 00:11:08.326 A:middle
the controls you have in
setting your price, the tools

188
00:11:08.326 --> 00:11:11.446 A:middle
and options you have to create
an ad that will make an impact,

189
00:11:12.406 --> 00:11:15.366 A:middle
and finally, the data
and insights you have

190
00:11:16.136 --> 00:11:18.936 A:middle
to understand your campaign
performance and optimize.

191
00:11:19.666 --> 00:11:21.826 A:middle
Let's start with
choosing your audience.

192
00:11:22.066 --> 00:11:26.596 A:middle
Selecting the right audience
for your app or product is key.

193
00:11:27.916 --> 00:11:31.126 A:middle
With iAd Workbench, we
make it very easy for you

194
00:11:31.406 --> 00:11:32.516 A:middle
to define your audience.

195
00:11:33.846 --> 00:11:37.896 A:middle
At the highest level,
you have two options.

196
00:11:37.896 --> 00:11:39.686 A:middle
Auto and Manual.

197
00:11:40.316 --> 00:11:44.766 A:middle
Auto targeting, which you saw
in the demo is the simplest

198
00:11:44.766 --> 00:11:47.726 A:middle
and probably the most powerful
option we have on iAd Workbench.

199
00:11:48.816 --> 00:11:52.386 A:middle
This is where iAd does all
the heavy lifting for you.

200
00:11:53.626 --> 00:11:56.656 A:middle
If you want control,
you can choose Manual.

201
00:11:58.016 --> 00:12:01.396 A:middle
When you choose Manual,
you'll have several options

202
00:12:02.716 --> 00:12:03.666 A:middle
to define your audience.

203
00:12:04.346 --> 00:12:07.516 A:middle
On the left side, you see
simple targeting options

204
00:12:08.246 --> 00:12:12.256 A:middle
like gender, age,
geo, and device.

205
00:12:13.266 --> 00:12:16.566 A:middle
You can choose, for age, you
can choose specific age groups

206
00:12:16.706 --> 00:12:17.636 A:middle
that you want to target.

207
00:12:18.526 --> 00:12:23.206 A:middle
For geo, you can choose
or specify states and DMAs

208
00:12:23.336 --> 00:12:24.786 A:middle
that you want to
target for your users.

209
00:12:26.156 --> 00:12:29.366 A:middle
On the right side, there are
some very powerful options.

210
00:12:30.836 --> 00:12:35.046 A:middle
Starting to the top, iTunes
Preferences is an option

211
00:12:35.416 --> 00:12:37.486 A:middle
that is exclusive to iAd.

212
00:12:38.826 --> 00:12:41.036 A:middle
This is where the
power of the App Store

213
00:12:41.196 --> 00:12:44.026 A:middle
and the iTunes Store
comes together

214
00:12:44.186 --> 00:12:45.686 A:middle
to help you find
the right audience.

215
00:12:47.176 --> 00:12:51.616 A:middle
When you make a selection here,
you're basically selecting users

216
00:12:52.166 --> 00:12:57.066 A:middle
who have actually downloaded
content in that category.

217
00:12:57.066 --> 00:13:01.406 A:middle
So if you were to promote
a health and fitness app,

218
00:13:01.666 --> 00:13:05.716 A:middle
wouldn't it be great if you
could choose the audience

219
00:13:05.986 --> 00:13:08.406 A:middle
who like to download
health and fitness apps,

220
00:13:09.526 --> 00:13:12.696 A:middle
or who like to download
fitness and workout music.

221
00:13:13.876 --> 00:13:15.856 A:middle
With iAd Workbench,
you can do that.

222
00:13:16.886 --> 00:13:17.776 A:middle
It's very powerful.

223
00:13:19.116 --> 00:13:22.206 A:middle
The next three options
lets you define

224
00:13:22.686 --> 00:13:24.766 A:middle
where your ad wants-where
you want to show your ad,

225
00:13:25.116 --> 00:13:26.206 A:middle
which is App Channels.

226
00:13:27.726 --> 00:13:30.336 A:middle
When you want to show
your ad, that's scheduling

227
00:13:31.146 --> 00:13:34.546 A:middle
and how often do you want to
show an ad to a particular user,

228
00:13:35.026 --> 00:13:36.076 A:middle
which is frequency capping.

229
00:13:37.476 --> 00:13:40.046 A:middle
You can mix and match
any of these options

230
00:13:40.886 --> 00:13:43.816 A:middle
to define the right
audience for your campaign.

231
00:13:45.996 --> 00:13:48.586 A:middle
Next, let's look at the
flexibility you have

232
00:13:48.636 --> 00:13:49.606 A:middle
in setting your price.

233
00:13:50.306 --> 00:13:55.046 A:middle
With iAd Workbench, you
can choose how you want

234
00:13:55.046 --> 00:13:56.236 A:middle
to pay for your campaign.

235
00:13:57.736 --> 00:14:00.606 A:middle
If you want to pay for every
click, you can choose CPC.

236
00:14:00.606 --> 00:14:03.806 A:middle
If you want to pay for
every thousand impressions,

237
00:14:04.486 --> 00:14:05.676 A:middle
you can choose CPM.

238
00:14:06.896 --> 00:14:10.416 A:middle
The bid you enter is the
maximum you're willing to pay

239
00:14:10.936 --> 00:14:12.006 A:middle
when you win the auction.

240
00:14:13.306 --> 00:14:16.086 A:middle
iAd Workbench is a
bidded marketplace.

241
00:14:16.996 --> 00:14:20.286 A:middle
And on this platform, you
have the peace of mind to know

242
00:14:21.276 --> 00:14:27.106 A:middle
that you only pay a penny more
than the next highest bidder.

243
00:14:27.286 --> 00:14:30.616 A:middle
Now let's look at the options
you have in creating your ad.

244
00:14:31.446 --> 00:14:33.256 A:middle
There are a range
of options you have

245
00:14:33.636 --> 00:14:35.066 A:middle
when it comes to
selecting your ad.

246
00:14:35.526 --> 00:14:40.876 A:middle
You can have Banner Ads, Video
Ads, which are also known

247
00:14:40.876 --> 00:14:45.246 A:middle
as pre-roll, and Rich-Media Ads
if you want higher engagement

248
00:14:45.246 --> 00:14:50.786 A:middle
of the users with your ads.

249
00:14:51.006 --> 00:14:54.426 A:middle
Banner ads provide a
direct path to action.

250
00:14:55.336 --> 00:14:58.016 A:middle
Upon tap of a banner, you
can take a user directly

251
00:14:58.046 --> 00:15:01.016 A:middle
to an iTunes product page
or to a mobile website.

252
00:15:02.156 --> 00:15:04.816 A:middle
Upon tap of a banner,
you can also take a user

253
00:15:05.596 --> 00:15:10.146 A:middle
and show them a video and then
take them to iTunes product page

254
00:15:10.246 --> 00:15:11.386 A:middle
or to a mobile website.

255
00:15:11.786 --> 00:15:16.706 A:middle
Let's take a look as an example
how a banner ad looks like.

256
00:15:17.676 --> 00:15:21.456 A:middle
Here's an app, you see the
ad will render at the bottom.

257
00:15:21.976 --> 00:15:25.416 A:middle
After a few seconds,
the ad will refresh,

258
00:15:27.336 --> 00:15:28.916 A:middle
the user engages with the ad.

259
00:15:28.916 --> 00:15:33.316 A:middle
And when the user clicks on it,

260
00:15:33.776 --> 00:15:35.066 A:middle
the user is taken
to the App Store.

261
00:15:36.076 --> 00:15:38.266 A:middle
The user can download
the app at this point.

262
00:15:39.376 --> 00:15:42.036 A:middle
Now once the user
downloads the app,

263
00:15:43.026 --> 00:15:46.916 A:middle
you don't show the same
download ad again to this user,

264
00:15:47.826 --> 00:15:52.646 A:middle
which means you don't waste your
money showing your ads to users

265
00:15:53.916 --> 00:15:55.466 A:middle
who already have your app.

266
00:15:57.446 --> 00:15:58.696 A:middle
Next is Video ads.

267
00:15:59.836 --> 00:16:03.406 A:middle
Video ads play automatically
before a video content.

268
00:16:04.196 --> 00:16:05.866 A:middle
They play directly
in fullscreen mode.

269
00:16:06.446 --> 00:16:10.196 A:middle
With video ads, you can also
have an optional call to action

270
00:16:10.756 --> 00:16:11.836 A:middle
which will take the user

271
00:16:11.836 --> 00:16:14.896 A:middle
to an iTunes product
page or a mobile website.

272
00:16:15.936 --> 00:16:17.606 A:middle
Here's an example of a video ad.

273
00:16:17.606 --> 00:16:19.196 A:middle
&gt;&gt; [Background Music]
You can chase light,

274
00:16:19.196 --> 00:16:22.316 A:middle
or let the light chase you.

275
00:16:22.316 --> 00:16:23.776 A:middle
Introducing LightRight,

276
00:16:23.776 --> 00:16:26.896 A:middle
an iOS bookmarking
tool for natural light.

277
00:16:26.896 --> 00:16:34.626 A:middle
LightRight for iPhone, now
available in the App Store.

278
00:16:34.626 --> 00:16:36.376 A:middle
&gt;&gt; As you noticed, there
was a Learn More link

279
00:16:36.376 --> 00:16:37.496 A:middle
at the bottom of that video.

280
00:16:37.956 --> 00:16:41.686 A:middle
The user clicks on that Learn
More link and the user is taken

281
00:16:41.686 --> 00:16:42.676 A:middle
to the iTunes product page.

282
00:16:42.676 --> 00:16:45.036 A:middle
You can also have the user
go to a mobile website.

283
00:16:45.736 --> 00:16:51.276 A:middle
If you want to create rich-media
ads for more higher engagement,

284
00:16:51.876 --> 00:16:53.906 A:middle
you can do that using
iAd Workbench as well.

285
00:16:55.226 --> 00:16:57.976 A:middle
Upon tap of a banner, you
can immerse your users

286
00:16:59.086 --> 00:17:01.676 A:middle
into a very custom product
or brand experience.

287
00:17:02.716 --> 00:17:06.046 A:middle
You can choose any combination
of features and any combination

288
00:17:06.046 --> 00:17:08.386 A:middle
of call to actions to
create a rich-media ad.

289
00:17:09.116 --> 00:17:10.356 A:middle
I'll show you an example

290
00:17:11.366 --> 00:17:14.586 A:middle
that the client had actually
used really good features

291
00:17:14.705 --> 00:17:16.376 A:middle
to create a great experience.

292
00:17:17.165 --> 00:17:17.675 A:middle
Let's take a look.

293
00:17:17.675 --> 00:17:19.326 A:middle
Here's the app.

294
00:17:19.576 --> 00:17:22.756 A:middle
You see the ad being rendered.

295
00:17:24.026 --> 00:17:27.056 A:middle
The user taps on the ad,
and is taken-is immersed

296
00:17:27.056 --> 00:17:28.185 A:middle
into a brand experience.

297
00:17:29.666 --> 00:17:32.056 A:middle
The user can browse through
the pictures gallery.

298
00:17:35.496 --> 00:17:39.776 A:middle
The user is still
within the app.

299
00:17:40.036 --> 00:17:41.566 A:middle
You can take the
user to Facebook

300
00:17:41.926 --> 00:17:43.486 A:middle
so you can have a
Facebook integration.

301
00:17:43.816 --> 00:17:46.206 A:middle
You can have the user like
your page on Facebook.

302
00:17:46.506 --> 00:17:52.906 A:middle
You can have the reservations
module within the ad.

303
00:17:53.146 --> 00:17:55.916 A:middle
And finally, you can even
integrate the app download right

304
00:17:55.916 --> 00:17:58.176 A:middle
from this place.

305
00:17:58.276 --> 00:18:01.016 A:middle
So as you see, you
can do a lot of things

306
00:18:01.016 --> 00:18:02.226 A:middle
when it comes to rich-media ads.

307
00:18:02.766 --> 00:18:08.126 A:middle
Now that awesome ad was
created using a free tool

308
00:18:08.126 --> 00:18:12.606 A:middle
that is available to everyone
which is called iAd Producer.

309
00:18:12.606 --> 00:18:19.196 A:middle
With iAd Producer, you can
create highly interactive

310
00:18:19.196 --> 00:18:19.846 A:middle
rich-media ads.

311
00:18:21.126 --> 00:18:24.266 A:middle
They made it so easy for
you that you can just drag

312
00:18:24.266 --> 00:18:26.916 A:middle
and drop your assets
in a visual layout.

313
00:18:27.536 --> 00:18:29.056 A:middle
Or you can customize
the visual layout.

314
00:18:29.496 --> 00:18:35.526 A:middle
We provide you with an extensive
library of over 500 blueprints

315
00:18:36.286 --> 00:18:37.156 A:middle
which are like templates.

316
00:18:37.846 --> 00:18:39.516 A:middle
And when you use one
of these blueprints,

317
00:18:39.966 --> 00:18:42.466 A:middle
they come with built-in
performance and analytics

318
00:18:42.606 --> 00:18:46.166 A:middle
so you can see how your user
is engaging and interacting

319
00:18:46.456 --> 00:18:47.996 A:middle
with the rich-media ad.

320
00:18:48.816 --> 00:18:51.436 A:middle
And finally, with
iAd Producer 4.2

321
00:18:51.716 --> 00:18:53.786 A:middle
that was introduced
just two weeks ago,

322
00:18:53.826 --> 00:19:00.156 A:middle
you have integrated iAd Producer
with Workbench, which means,

323
00:19:00.776 --> 00:19:02.656 A:middle
if you create an ad
using iAd Producer,

324
00:19:03.166 --> 00:19:06.466 A:middle
you can now upload it
directly on to Workbench.

325
00:19:07.446 --> 00:19:12.516 A:middle
And when you go to Workbench,
you'll have it available to use.

326
00:19:14.856 --> 00:19:16.516 A:middle
So once you create
your campaign,

327
00:19:17.036 --> 00:19:20.326 A:middle
your campaign is
running and you want

328
00:19:20.326 --> 00:19:21.906 A:middle
to see how the campaign
is performing.

329
00:19:22.366 --> 00:19:26.126 A:middle
When it comes to
campaign performance,

330
00:19:26.236 --> 00:19:28.866 A:middle
we provide you rich analytics

331
00:19:29.476 --> 00:19:31.556 A:middle
that helps you understand
how your campaign is doing

332
00:19:31.556 --> 00:19:33.046 A:middle
so you can take the
right actions.

333
00:19:33.536 --> 00:19:36.556 A:middle
We give you data,
performance metrics,

334
00:19:36.556 --> 00:19:38.946 A:middle
as well as conversion metrics
which includes, you know,

335
00:19:38.946 --> 00:19:40.906 A:middle
what your spend is,
your capture rate is,

336
00:19:41.146 --> 00:19:44.556 A:middle
number of impressions you
got, as well as the downloads

337
00:19:44.556 --> 00:19:47.946 A:middle
that you've received so
you can tune your campaign.

338
00:19:49.326 --> 00:19:51.236 A:middle
We provide you this
data at every level

339
00:19:52.586 --> 00:19:55.366 A:middle
at the aggregate
campaign level as well

340
00:19:55.366 --> 00:19:59.966 A:middle
as at lower line and ad levels.

341
00:20:00.046 --> 00:20:03.936 A:middle
You can also download this
data as a .CSV file from any

342
00:20:03.936 --> 00:20:04.876 A:middle
of the analytic screens.

343
00:20:05.396 --> 00:20:10.256 A:middle
So, at this point, I'll ask
Ravi to walk us through some

344
00:20:10.256 --> 00:20:11.676 A:middle
of these tools and
options that we talked

345
00:20:11.676 --> 00:20:13.766 A:middle
about to make your
advertising work.

346
00:20:14.916 --> 00:20:15.796 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Paresh.

347
00:20:15.796 --> 00:20:22.926 A:middle
In this demo, I'm going
to walk you through some

348
00:20:22.926 --> 00:20:24.926 A:middle
of the core concepts that
Paresh has mentioned,

349
00:20:25.826 --> 00:20:29.596 A:middle
touch and targeting, some of
the new ad formats analytics.

350
00:20:30.206 --> 00:20:31.886 A:middle
Let's get started.

351
00:20:32.966 --> 00:20:35.936 A:middle
I've been working on a
campaign I'm halfway through it,

352
00:20:37.146 --> 00:20:39.056 A:middle
let's finish this
campaign together.

353
00:20:42.686 --> 00:20:46.086 A:middle
I created a campaign and
created just one line

354
00:20:47.506 --> 00:20:50.376 A:middle
with a manual targeting
and I want

355
00:20:50.376 --> 00:20:52.116 A:middle
to finish-show you
what targeting I've set

356
00:20:52.116 --> 00:20:57.416 A:middle
up by editing the
line and later,

357
00:20:57.416 --> 00:20:59.896 A:middle
we'll add ads to this one.

358
00:21:00.446 --> 00:21:10.146 A:middle
A targeting option, we're going
to select as Manual and this-and

359
00:21:10.146 --> 00:21:12.576 A:middle
for the country, let's
leave it as United States.

360
00:21:12.696 --> 00:21:17.026 A:middle
And these are the
different targeting options

361
00:21:17.246 --> 00:21:18.186 A:middle
that we have available.

362
00:21:20.636 --> 00:21:23.256 A:middle
You can see all the options
on the left-hand side.

363
00:21:23.956 --> 00:21:26.566 A:middle
On the right, you will see the
options that we have selected.

364
00:21:26.566 --> 00:21:28.176 A:middle
By default, it's All.

365
00:21:30.516 --> 00:21:35.936 A:middle
Next, I'm going to target
few of the app references.

366
00:21:36.556 --> 00:21:43.886 A:middle
I'm going to select Lifestyle,
Photo and Video and Travel.

367
00:21:46.246 --> 00:21:48.896 A:middle
Then for App Channels, I
want to do similar thing.

368
00:21:50.776 --> 00:21:51.946 A:middle
I'm going to do Lifestyle,

369
00:21:52.126 --> 00:21:56.946 A:middle
I'm going to do Photo
and Video and Travel.

370
00:21:58.746 --> 00:22:02.076 A:middle
You can always select
more based upon,

371
00:22:02.076 --> 00:22:03.066 A:middle
you know, how it's performing.

372
00:22:04.426 --> 00:22:08.486 A:middle
For app type, last time we
did for creative: banner.

373
00:22:09.906 --> 00:22:12.026 A:middle
This time we're going to
do video as a creative

374
00:22:13.356 --> 00:22:14.716 A:middle
to a website as a destination.

375
00:22:15.746 --> 00:22:17.666 A:middle
My goal here is to drive
traffic to the website.

376
00:22:17.666 --> 00:22:23.706 A:middle
And for flight dates,
let's leave it as a default

377
00:22:23.706 --> 00:22:27.226 A:middle
and I've given some
spend, budget and bid here.

378
00:22:27.226 --> 00:22:35.076 A:middle
Let's go to the next step
where we can create an ad.

379
00:22:36.936 --> 00:22:39.726 A:middle
Here we have two choices,
a banner or a video.

380
00:22:39.726 --> 00:22:41.776 A:middle
Let's select video.

381
00:22:41.776 --> 00:22:48.486 A:middle
And where your ad-you want
your ad to run for devices

382
00:22:48.486 --> 00:22:50.746 A:middle
for maximum reach,
let's pick Universal.

383
00:22:52.006 --> 00:22:54.926 A:middle
For language, let's
keep it at English.

384
00:22:56.236 --> 00:22:59.556 A:middle
And here we are at a step where
we need to upload a video file.

385
00:22:59.556 --> 00:23:05.436 A:middle
iAd Workbench supports
two formats

386
00:23:05.436 --> 00:23:09.216 A:middle
for the video file,
.M4V and .MOV.

387
00:23:09.406 --> 00:23:11.156 A:middle
There are few more
specs here right here.

388
00:23:12.616 --> 00:23:14.586 A:middle
We encourage you to follow
the specs so you don't trip

389
00:23:14.586 --> 00:23:15.666 A:middle
on any validation errors.

390
00:23:16.146 --> 00:23:17.656 A:middle
Let's upload.

391
00:23:22.856 --> 00:23:24.936 A:middle
The file is being
uploaded from my laptop

392
00:23:25.266 --> 00:23:28.556 A:middle
to the Workbench
servers right now.

393
00:23:28.626 --> 00:23:30.156 A:middle
Once the file reaches
the servers,

394
00:23:30.786 --> 00:23:34.006 A:middle
the file will be transcoded
to multiple formats

395
00:23:35.336 --> 00:23:37.336 A:middle
to suit the devices
and resolutions

396
00:23:37.876 --> 00:23:41.836 A:middle
like iPhone high res, low res,
iPad high res and low res.

397
00:23:43.626 --> 00:23:44.656 A:middle
It's uploading right now.

398
00:23:48.906 --> 00:23:50.386 A:middle
Let it take its time.

399
00:23:53.166 --> 00:23:55.556 A:middle
I guess everybody is using
the network bandwidth I guess.

400
00:23:57.026 --> 00:23:58.876 A:middle
So, right now it seems like
the file has reached the server

401
00:23:58.876 --> 00:24:00.926 A:middle
as you saw the status
changed to Formatting.

402
00:24:02.686 --> 00:24:04.886 A:middle
This is when the video
transcoding is happening.

403
00:24:06.306 --> 00:24:09.026 A:middle
It's actually transforming the
video to suit the other devices.

404
00:24:09.126 --> 00:24:12.536 A:middle
Let's take a quick review.

405
00:24:17.666 --> 00:24:19.776 A:middle
&gt;&gt; [Background Music]
You can chase light

406
00:24:19.776 --> 00:24:22.906 A:middle
or let the light chase you.

407
00:24:22.906 --> 00:24:24.356 A:middle
Introducing LightRight,

408
00:24:24.356 --> 00:24:27.676 A:middle
an iOS bookmarking
tool for natural light.

409
00:24:27.676 --> 00:24:37.796 A:middle
LightRight for iPhone, now
available from the App Store.

410
00:24:37.796 --> 00:24:38.536 A:middle
&gt;&gt; That was a cool video.

411
00:24:38.896 --> 00:24:42.056 A:middle
I just want to highlight
one thing here.

412
00:24:42.996 --> 00:24:48.446 A:middle
For you as an advertiser,
prepare one file

413
00:24:48.446 --> 00:24:52.056 A:middle
to one technical
specification and be assured

414
00:24:52.056 --> 00:24:57.746 A:middle
that your ad-video ad is going
to run on all the Apple devices

415
00:24:58.276 --> 00:25:06.136 A:middle
in the best way possible,
so, that's how simple it is

416
00:25:06.136 --> 00:25:10.806 A:middle
to create a video ad here.

417
00:25:10.976 --> 00:25:15.466 A:middle
Use this ad format, we encourage
you to take advantage of it.

418
00:25:15.716 --> 00:25:16.776 A:middle
Let's select the destination.

419
00:25:17.206 --> 00:25:19.916 A:middle
As I said I'm going
to the website.

420
00:25:20.646 --> 00:25:23.076 A:middle
You can view the URL right here.

421
00:25:29.466 --> 00:25:33.356 A:middle
And then it will ask you for
the destination, for the name.

422
00:25:34.246 --> 00:25:35.706 A:middle
I like the name LightRight
website here.

423
00:25:35.706 --> 00:25:38.276 A:middle
So I'm going to leave it as is.

424
00:25:38.406 --> 00:25:40.776 A:middle
For this app to go live, you
need to assign to the line.

425
00:25:41.176 --> 00:25:43.316 A:middle
I'm going to assign to the video
line that I created earlier.

426
00:25:46.976 --> 00:25:47.986 A:middle
Let's name the ad.

427
00:25:49.086 --> 00:25:51.476 A:middle
I'm going to name it
as My Awesome Video.

428
00:25:57.886 --> 00:26:00.446 A:middle
Clicking on Next will take
us to the Ad Summary page.

429
00:26:02.446 --> 00:26:07.456 A:middle
So, that's the demo of the
powerful ad format video ad.

430
00:26:09.126 --> 00:26:14.676 A:middle
So far in my two
demos, we mainly focused

431
00:26:14.676 --> 00:26:17.276 A:middle
on creating a campaign,
on editing a campaign,

432
00:26:17.866 --> 00:26:19.926 A:middle
focused on a little bit on
targeting and ad formats.

433
00:26:21.096 --> 00:26:24.146 A:middle
Once a campaign is
created, the next thing

434
00:26:24.146 --> 00:26:27.686 A:middle
to focus is monitoring the
performance of the campaign

435
00:26:28.566 --> 00:26:33.136 A:middle
to ensure that it is going
towards the goal you have set

436
00:26:33.136 --> 00:26:33.526 A:middle
out for.

437
00:26:37.346 --> 00:26:39.306 A:middle
In order to monitor the
performance of the campaign,

438
00:26:40.286 --> 00:26:41.206 A:middle
we have some analytics.

439
00:26:42.576 --> 00:26:44.846 A:middle
So, next, I want you to
take-I want to take you

440
00:26:44.846 --> 00:26:45.846 A:middle
to the analytics pages.

441
00:26:48.836 --> 00:26:51.626 A:middle
I have these two campaigns
that have been running

442
00:26:51.626 --> 00:26:54.066 A:middle
for the last 6 months.

443
00:26:54.066 --> 00:26:56.886 A:middle
I want to show the
performance of these campaigns.

444
00:26:57.086 --> 00:27:01.406 A:middle
As you see the Dashboard
used the basic metrics spend,

445
00:27:01.846 --> 00:27:04.486 A:middle
impressions, TTR
and conversions.

446
00:27:04.986 --> 00:27:09.386 A:middle
You can click on any of these
metrics and go into the details.

447
00:27:12.396 --> 00:27:14.556 A:middle
By default, it gives
Since Campaign Start

448
00:27:14.816 --> 00:27:20.426 A:middle
and you have different custom
data groups you can select

449
00:27:20.426 --> 00:27:21.356 A:middle
that we have prepared for you.

450
00:27:21.916 --> 00:27:23.146 A:middle
Let me select last 30 days.

451
00:27:26.616 --> 00:27:29.076 A:middle
That's the spend for the last
30 days for this campaign.

452
00:27:30.506 --> 00:27:32.456 A:middle
Seems like we are spending
more in the weekends

453
00:27:32.626 --> 00:27:34.786 A:middle
and spend is coming down
during the weekdays.

454
00:27:35.386 --> 00:27:38.986 A:middle
You have different
metrics that you can view.

455
00:27:39.446 --> 00:27:40.166 A:middle
I've listed here.

456
00:27:40.166 --> 00:27:48.276 A:middle
And you can overlay any
metric on top of it.

457
00:27:48.496 --> 00:27:50.746 A:middle
Or if you want to compare
how you've been spending,

458
00:27:51.836 --> 00:27:53.056 A:middle
compare to the previous period,

459
00:27:53.586 --> 00:27:56.316 A:middle
you can always select
Compare with Previous Period.

460
00:27:57.256 --> 00:28:01.496 A:middle
That gives you how the last 30
days is performing as opposed

461
00:28:01.496 --> 00:28:06.296 A:middle
to the previous 30 days.

462
00:28:06.326 --> 00:28:08.246 A:middle
Overlay is a pretty neat feature

463
00:28:08.246 --> 00:28:17.166 A:middle
where you can overlay any metric
here and compare to the spend.

464
00:28:17.166 --> 00:28:18.596 A:middle
I ordered average CPA metric.

465
00:28:19.316 --> 00:28:22.226 A:middle
It seems like we are doing less

466
00:28:22.226 --> 00:28:23.646 A:middle
than 2 dollars for
download here.

467
00:28:27.336 --> 00:28:28.286 A:middle
Let's go into the lines.

468
00:28:30.916 --> 00:28:32.906 A:middle
By default, it gives you
the cumulative number.

469
00:28:34.116 --> 00:28:36.936 A:middle
You can always select
Time, Time Series graph

470
00:28:37.186 --> 00:28:38.376 A:middle
to see how the lines
are performing.

471
00:28:38.936 --> 00:28:42.116 A:middle
It seems like we are spending
more on this line than this one.

472
00:28:42.316 --> 00:28:50.026 A:middle
And you can do similar
analysis on ad side as well.

473
00:28:50.186 --> 00:28:53.066 A:middle
By default, it gives you
the spend for cumulative.

474
00:28:53.156 --> 00:28:56.466 A:middle
You can always change
the metrics and change

475
00:28:56.466 --> 00:28:57.566 A:middle
to the time series graph.

476
00:28:58.866 --> 00:29:00.626 A:middle
We're pretty close on
these two ads here.

477
00:29:00.626 --> 00:29:04.786 A:middle
Let me go back to
the summary and find

478
00:29:04.786 --> 00:29:05.686 A:middle
out a couple of things here.

479
00:29:06.356 --> 00:29:08.886 A:middle
You can easily toggle between
a graph and a table view

480
00:29:09.296 --> 00:29:10.156 A:middle
if you choose to do so.

481
00:29:12.906 --> 00:29:16.536 A:middle
Or if you can scroll down and
you can click on Download CSV

482
00:29:16.536 --> 00:29:22.136 A:middle
to get a file onto your
desktop and do offline analysis.

483
00:29:22.816 --> 00:29:25.676 A:middle
And Download CSV is available
across the board on Dashboard

484
00:29:26.096 --> 00:29:28.946 A:middle
on every analytic
space that we have.

485
00:29:32.636 --> 00:29:35.176 A:middle
So, that's a quick
overview of, you know,

486
00:29:35.176 --> 00:29:37.576 A:middle
how to measure the
performance of your campaign.

487
00:29:39.276 --> 00:29:42.056 A:middle
All the data that I've been
showing in last 5 minutes,

488
00:29:42.596 --> 00:29:44.376 A:middle
that data is available
through the API.

489
00:29:45.896 --> 00:29:48.346 A:middle
So, next, I'm going to drop you
through the complete overview

490
00:29:48.346 --> 00:29:51.216 A:middle
of iAd Workbench API that
we have released this year.

491
00:29:52.366 --> 00:29:54.966 A:middle
So, your-you are an advertiser.

492
00:29:55.406 --> 00:29:57.586 A:middle
You have created
multiple campaigns

493
00:29:58.286 --> 00:30:00.336 A:middle
and managing all
those campaigns.

494
00:30:01.336 --> 00:30:03.756 A:middle
And you want to scale
beyond the web interface.

495
00:30:05.556 --> 00:30:06.696 A:middle
API is for you.

496
00:30:08.056 --> 00:30:11.076 A:middle
Say you're an advertiser who
wanted to get the metrics

497
00:30:11.256 --> 00:30:14.216 A:middle
and incorporate it to
your own dashboards.

498
00:30:15.516 --> 00:30:16.356 A:middle
API is for you.

499
00:30:17.766 --> 00:30:19.586 A:middle
Let's get into the-more details.

500
00:30:20.846 --> 00:30:22.456 A:middle
You can also use it
for bulk operations.

501
00:30:26.316 --> 00:30:29.176 A:middle
API has two broad categories.

502
00:30:31.486 --> 00:30:37.576 A:middle
Reporting, where you can get the
metrics and perform the offline

503
00:30:37.576 --> 00:30:38.636 A:middle
and real-time analysis.

504
00:30:39.056 --> 00:30:42.966 A:middle
What do I mean by
real-time analysis here?

505
00:30:43.176 --> 00:30:45.406 A:middle
You can write a program for
example that runs at the top

506
00:30:45.406 --> 00:30:50.446 A:middle
of every hour, get some
metrics, analyze the data

507
00:30:50.616 --> 00:30:53.296 A:middle
and modify your campaign data.

508
00:30:53.296 --> 00:30:57.426 A:middle
You can trace the bid, start
and stop a campaign ad.

509
00:30:58.726 --> 00:31:00.456 A:middle
That's what I'm talking
about real-time analysis.

510
00:31:00.886 --> 00:31:04.296 A:middle
For offline analysis, you
can do your own dashboards.

511
00:31:04.456 --> 00:31:11.196 A:middle
And campaign management, you
can get the campaign details,

512
00:31:11.526 --> 00:31:13.956 A:middle
update the critical
campaign data and start

513
00:31:13.956 --> 00:31:15.926 A:middle
and stop campaign lines or ads.

514
00:31:19.336 --> 00:31:20.996 A:middle
Let's get into some very basics.

515
00:31:20.996 --> 00:31:22.256 A:middle
We're talking about API here.

516
00:31:23.946 --> 00:31:29.876 A:middle
For communication, API
uses JSON or HTTPS.

517
00:31:29.876 --> 00:31:33.326 A:middle
We want to keep the data
protocol pretty simple

518
00:31:33.326 --> 00:31:35.896 A:middle
so it's easy to understand
and it's easy to test.

519
00:31:36.396 --> 00:31:41.266 A:middle
We use JSON for data protocol
and secure HTTPS for security.

520
00:31:41.856 --> 00:31:50.306 A:middle
The next: authentication, we use
client certificates, private key

521
00:31:50.306 --> 00:31:55.106 A:middle
and access token as a
combination for authentication,

522
00:31:55.106 --> 00:31:56.776 A:middle
making it a very
strong authentication.

523
00:31:57.286 --> 00:32:02.616 A:middle
And for key management, we want
to make it as easy as possible

524
00:32:03.616 --> 00:32:05.896 A:middle
so you can be having
web interface

525
00:32:05.896 --> 00:32:08.086 A:middle
for that on Workbench app.

526
00:32:12.196 --> 00:32:13.466 A:middle
So, how do you initiate
this API?

527
00:32:13.466 --> 00:32:17.826 A:middle
We have three basic
steps: download keys,

528
00:32:18.096 --> 00:32:19.676 A:middle
verify keys and integrate.

529
00:32:20.166 --> 00:32:25.886 A:middle
Go to Workbench,
go to the API page,

530
00:32:26.486 --> 00:32:29.126 A:middle
click on the Download
link to download the keys.

531
00:32:30.306 --> 00:32:32.696 A:middle
When you download the keys,
we give you a .zip file

532
00:32:32.696 --> 00:32:34.446 A:middle
that has keys and
sample programs.

533
00:32:34.576 --> 00:32:39.826 A:middle
And sample programs are
already embedded with your keys.

534
00:32:40.026 --> 00:32:42.616 A:middle
Run those sample programs
and verify the keys.

535
00:32:43.106 --> 00:32:47.686 A:middle
And then download the
API programming guide,

536
00:32:49.966 --> 00:32:53.096 A:middle
write your own programs,
deploy them on your servers

537
00:32:53.146 --> 00:32:56.196 A:middle
and integrate, that's
how simple it is.

538
00:32:57.946 --> 00:33:00.296 A:middle
Let me quickly walk you through
some of the core methods here.

539
00:33:00.776 --> 00:33:05.996 A:middle
We have InitSession for session
initialization, which is key

540
00:33:06.436 --> 00:33:08.506 A:middle
because you need to pass the
sessionId for every method

541
00:33:08.506 --> 00:33:11.476 A:middle
that you are going to call
in your program for API.

542
00:33:12.766 --> 00:33:18.106 A:middle
Campaign method-metadata methods
to get the campaign details,

543
00:33:18.216 --> 00:33:20.226 A:middle
reporting API to
get the metrics.

544
00:33:20.226 --> 00:33:26.626 A:middle
And campaign management
API to update the details

545
00:33:26.626 --> 00:33:32.446 A:middle
as well as start and stop.

546
00:33:32.566 --> 00:33:33.856 A:middle
Now, I'm going to
walk you through some

547
00:33:33.856 --> 00:33:36.926 A:middle
of the sample program that
I've already done using the

548
00:33:36.926 --> 00:33:39.136 A:middle
highlighted methods
here, InitSession,

549
00:33:39.626 --> 00:33:45.746 A:middle
GetCampaignDetails
and UpdateLine.

550
00:33:45.746 --> 00:33:49.836 A:middle
So, here is a sample program,
sample method where I'm trying

551
00:33:49.836 --> 00:33:53.666 A:middle
to pass access token,
prepare the request tab,

552
00:33:55.596 --> 00:34:00.386 A:middle
post it to the server
then get the response back

553
00:34:00.386 --> 00:34:03.646 A:middle
and read the session from that,
sessionId from the response.

554
00:34:03.916 --> 00:34:08.786 A:middle
Once I get the sessionId,
I pass the sessionId

555
00:34:09.516 --> 00:34:14.826 A:middle
to getCampaignDetails method,
get the campaign IDs and filter

556
00:34:14.826 --> 00:34:18.246 A:middle
by running state, post
that to the server,

557
00:34:18.246 --> 00:34:20.646 A:middle
get the response back.

558
00:34:22.386 --> 00:34:27.686 A:middle
Next, for the campaign details
I got, I'm passing the LineId

559
00:34:27.686 --> 00:34:29.005 A:middle
for which I want to
increase the bid.

560
00:34:29.936 --> 00:34:33.426 A:middle
So I gave the line-SessionId,
LineId and the CPMBid,

561
00:34:37.016 --> 00:34:40.096 A:middle
post to server, and
get the response back.

562
00:34:41.666 --> 00:34:44.275 A:middle
That's how simple it is
to write the programs

563
00:34:44.275 --> 00:34:49.206 A:middle
to communicate with the API.

564
00:34:49.426 --> 00:34:55.545 A:middle
Powerful, secure and easy
to use, go try it out.

565
00:34:56.146 --> 00:35:00.746 A:middle
With this, I'm going to
pass on to Paresh to walk us

566
00:35:00.746 --> 00:35:02.026 A:middle
through what's coming next.

567
00:35:02.916 --> 00:35:03.486 A:middle
There you go Paresh.

568
00:35:04.916 --> 00:35:05.496 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Ravi.

569
00:35:05.786 --> 00:35:08.286 A:middle
It's fascinating what
you can do with the APIs

570
00:35:08.626 --> 00:35:10.816 A:middle
and how you can make bulk
changes to your campaigns

571
00:35:10.996 --> 00:35:12.176 A:middle
from your own user interface.

572
00:35:12.816 --> 00:35:17.506 A:middle
So, what's coming this fall?

573
00:35:17.706 --> 00:35:21.146 A:middle
So far, we've talked about
how iAd Workbench can help you

574
00:35:21.146 --> 00:35:22.706 A:middle
acquire new customers.

575
00:35:24.026 --> 00:35:25.556 A:middle
But that's just half the battle.

576
00:35:26.356 --> 00:35:30.566 A:middle
For you to grow your business,
you also need to re-engage

577
00:35:30.566 --> 00:35:34.586 A:middle
with your existing customers
and have them do more

578
00:35:34.586 --> 00:35:39.566 A:middle
of what you want, whether it's
spending more time in your app,

579
00:35:39.856 --> 00:35:42.966 A:middle
buying more of your products,
or even trying your new apps.

580
00:35:43.616 --> 00:35:47.116 A:middle
I came across a study
recently on the web

581
00:35:48.086 --> 00:35:49.866 A:middle
by a mobile analytics
firm, Localytics,

582
00:35:50.836 --> 00:35:53.196 A:middle
which said 22 percent
of the apps

583
00:35:53.196 --> 00:35:58.286 A:middle
that were downloaded were used
only once and over 60 percent

584
00:35:58.286 --> 00:36:01.416 A:middle
of them were used
less than 10 times.

585
00:36:02.916 --> 00:36:05.516 A:middle
Now, you want users
to frequently engage

586
00:36:05.516 --> 00:36:07.346 A:middle
with your app or your website.

587
00:36:07.796 --> 00:36:11.766 A:middle
Let's take a few examples
how engaged-re-engaging

588
00:36:11.766 --> 00:36:14.076 A:middle
with your customers can
help you grow your business.

589
00:36:16.846 --> 00:36:19.816 A:middle
First example is
about a game app.

590
00:36:20.706 --> 00:36:26.536 A:middle
So you came up with a new iPad
version of your iPhone game.

591
00:36:26.736 --> 00:36:32.326 A:middle
Now, who will be the best
customers for this new app?

592
00:36:33.496 --> 00:36:37.156 A:middle
Of course, the users who
use that game on the iPhone.

593
00:36:37.156 --> 00:36:44.296 A:middle
What if you had a way to
connect with these customers

594
00:36:45.326 --> 00:36:48.056 A:middle
and inform them about
your new game?

595
00:36:48.506 --> 00:36:52.126 A:middle
And what if you could inform
them about this new game

596
00:36:52.766 --> 00:36:56.966 A:middle
when they are on their iPad?

597
00:36:57.106 --> 00:36:59.296 A:middle
Or, say you enhanced your app

598
00:36:59.296 --> 00:37:01.466 A:middle
and you added more
levels more game levels

599
00:37:01.546 --> 00:37:05.886 A:middle
or you have more things that
you want to sell in your app.

600
00:37:06.156 --> 00:37:10.636 A:middle
What if you had a way to
re-engage with the users

601
00:37:11.166 --> 00:37:17.196 A:middle
and show or promote these
levels only to users

602
00:37:17.196 --> 00:37:20.416 A:middle
who have reached certain
levels in your game

603
00:37:20.596 --> 00:37:23.436 A:middle
or show this merchandise
only to users

604
00:37:23.436 --> 00:37:28.086 A:middle
who actually buy
merchandise like this?

605
00:37:28.136 --> 00:37:32.796 A:middle
And what about all those
users who downloaded your app

606
00:37:33.416 --> 00:37:37.386 A:middle
but haven't used it
in the last two weeks?

607
00:37:37.516 --> 00:37:40.496 A:middle
What if you had a way
to reconnect with them

608
00:37:41.356 --> 00:37:45.496 A:middle
and motivate them to try-come
back and try your app again?

609
00:37:46.496 --> 00:37:47.936 A:middle
And what if you could
connect with them

610
00:37:48.016 --> 00:37:49.046 A:middle
when they're not in your app?

611
00:37:49.616 --> 00:37:51.756 A:middle
Let's take another example.

612
00:37:52.256 --> 00:37:55.446 A:middle
A retail app.

613
00:37:55.446 --> 00:37:57.026 A:middle
Say you have a retail app.

614
00:37:57.336 --> 00:38:00.576 A:middle
Now, you have users who browse
through your product catalog

615
00:38:01.346 --> 00:38:03.206 A:middle
and add things to
the shopping basket.

616
00:38:04.106 --> 00:38:08.896 A:middle
Many of these users exit the
app before they actually make

617
00:38:09.666 --> 00:38:10.706 A:middle
a purchase.

618
00:38:10.836 --> 00:38:16.416 A:middle
What if you had a way to find
these users and bring them back

619
00:38:16.696 --> 00:38:19.126 A:middle
to finish the purchase and what

620
00:38:19.126 --> 00:38:22.266 A:middle
if you could bring them
back exactly at the point

621
00:38:22.266 --> 00:38:24.326 A:middle
where they had left
in the shopping basket

622
00:38:25.296 --> 00:38:27.766 A:middle
so they can finish the
transaction in next step.

623
00:38:28.116 --> 00:38:33.776 A:middle
And if you want to send offers
to your loyal customers,

624
00:38:34.976 --> 00:38:36.416 A:middle
what if you could
show these offers

625
00:38:36.416 --> 00:38:38.496 A:middle
to your loyal customers
irrespective

626
00:38:38.496 --> 00:38:40.616 A:middle
of what iOS device they are on?

627
00:38:41.086 --> 00:38:47.066 A:middle
And for users and your
customers who have items

628
00:38:47.066 --> 00:38:50.326 A:middle
in their wish list, what if
you could reconnect with these

629
00:38:51.436 --> 00:38:54.436 A:middle
and inform them when the items
on the wish list are on sale?

630
00:38:54.436 --> 00:38:59.626 A:middle
Now, in each of these
examples that we talked about,

631
00:38:59.826 --> 00:39:02.086 A:middle
we talked about reconnecting

632
00:39:02.086 --> 00:39:03.856 A:middle
with a specific group
of audience.

633
00:39:05.396 --> 00:39:08.486 A:middle
Whether it's all the customers
who have downloaded your app

634
00:39:09.166 --> 00:39:12.896 A:middle
or the dormant users who
haven't used your app,

635
00:39:12.976 --> 00:39:17.936 A:middle
or the loyal users who do
purchases for you, or the users

636
00:39:18.056 --> 00:39:22.186 A:middle
who have an abandoned cart
on your shopping-on your app.

637
00:39:22.406 --> 00:39:28.696 A:middle
We call this group of
audiences as "segments".

638
00:39:29.426 --> 00:39:32.976 A:middle
Now there are probably
a million ways you could

639
00:39:32.976 --> 00:39:34.116 A:middle
segment audiences.

640
00:39:35.266 --> 00:39:38.246 A:middle
You know your business and
your app, and your users best.

641
00:39:38.946 --> 00:39:42.156 A:middle
So you will segment your
users the way you want it.

642
00:39:42.866 --> 00:39:45.326 A:middle
And for you to easily
create segments,

643
00:39:47.156 --> 00:39:49.876 A:middle
we're introducing a new
functionality this fall

644
00:39:50.146 --> 00:39:54.346 A:middle
with iOS 8 which we call
Audience Segmentation.

645
00:39:55.736 --> 00:39:59.026 A:middle
Building segments using Audience
Segmentation is very easy.

646
00:39:59.816 --> 00:40:01.386 A:middle
You can do it in just two steps.

647
00:40:03.436 --> 00:40:08.686 A:middle
The first one is you get
segment IDs from iAd Workbench.

648
00:40:10.116 --> 00:40:14.496 A:middle
Now, every segment is unique
so it has a unique segment ID.

649
00:40:15.346 --> 00:40:17.846 A:middle
You can download the segment
IDs from iAd Workbench.

650
00:40:18.906 --> 00:40:20.286 A:middle
Once you get the segment IDs,

651
00:40:20.986 --> 00:40:24.546 A:middle
you then integrate those
segment IDs in your app.

652
00:40:26.496 --> 00:40:29.886 A:middle
You map the user behavior of
the functionality you have

653
00:40:29.886 --> 00:40:32.466 A:middle
in the app with these
segment IDs.

654
00:40:33.816 --> 00:40:36.596 A:middle
And when the user demonstrates
a particular user behavior

655
00:40:37.076 --> 00:40:40.226 A:middle
or reaches a functionality,
say reaches a particular level,

656
00:40:41.026 --> 00:40:42.776 A:middle
you instrument it in a way

657
00:40:42.776 --> 00:40:48.136 A:middle
that you automatically make API
call using the new iOS 8 SDK,

658
00:40:48.136 --> 00:40:52.636 A:middle
and pass that segment
ID onto Workbench.

659
00:40:54.416 --> 00:40:55.736 A:middle
Now when you do that,

660
00:40:56.446 --> 00:40:59.366 A:middle
your segments will automatically
start getting populated

661
00:40:59.476 --> 00:41:00.296 A:middle
on iAd Workbench.

662
00:41:00.756 --> 00:41:03.986 A:middle
Here's an example where
segmentation was done based

663
00:41:03.986 --> 00:41:05.976 A:middle
on time spent in an app.

664
00:41:07.116 --> 00:41:10.616 A:middle
To avail your segments, users
who have spent less than 1 hour

665
00:41:10.616 --> 00:41:17.486 A:middle
in the app, 1 to 10 hours, 10 to
20 and 20 plus hours in the app.

666
00:41:17.746 --> 00:41:21.106 A:middle
Now, if you were to reconnect
or re-engage with these users,

667
00:41:21.976 --> 00:41:25.066 A:middle
you would probably have a very
different strategy when it comes

668
00:41:25.066 --> 00:41:28.506 A:middle
to reengaging you with users
who have spent less than an hour

669
00:41:28.506 --> 00:41:32.306 A:middle
in your app compared to who
have spent more than 20 hours.

670
00:41:34.476 --> 00:41:36.256 A:middle
Here's another example

671
00:41:36.406 --> 00:41:39.296 A:middle
where segmentation is
based on levels of use.

672
00:41:41.996 --> 00:41:44.536 A:middle
Whenever a user reaches
a particular level,

673
00:41:45.646 --> 00:41:47.276 A:middle
they go from level 1 to level 2.

674
00:41:47.946 --> 00:41:50.826 A:middle
The API call that I talked
about is automatically made

675
00:41:50.826 --> 00:41:52.466 A:middle
from the client side
from your app

676
00:41:53.316 --> 00:41:54.866 A:middle
and the right segment
ID is passed

677
00:41:55.406 --> 00:41:57.736 A:middle
and the user gets added
to this new segment.

678
00:41:58.636 --> 00:42:01.616 A:middle
So once you do segmentation
this way using iOS 8,

679
00:42:02.956 --> 00:42:07.456 A:middle
we can unlock some amazing
things which brings us

680
00:42:07.456 --> 00:42:09.376 A:middle
to the second thing that
we're introducing this fall,

681
00:42:10.326 --> 00:42:12.096 A:middle
we call it Audience Insights.

682
00:42:14.296 --> 00:42:17.776 A:middle
When your segments reach a
particular threshold of users,

683
00:42:19.176 --> 00:42:22.576 A:middle
we will show you unique audience
insights into your segments,

684
00:42:23.826 --> 00:42:26.826 A:middle
all for free at no charge.

685
00:42:27.356 --> 00:42:29.306 A:middle
These insights are
based on iTunes data.

686
00:42:30.726 --> 00:42:33.556 A:middle
So we'll show you how the
distribution is of the users

687
00:42:33.556 --> 00:42:35.976 A:middle
in your segment, the
demographic distribution.

688
00:42:36.936 --> 00:42:40.236 A:middle
How age, gender, household
income distribution is

689
00:42:40.346 --> 00:42:41.076 A:middle
for these users.

690
00:42:42.626 --> 00:42:46.666 A:middle
We'll show you the top regions,
the top countries, top states,

691
00:42:46.896 --> 00:42:51.556 A:middle
DMAs these users come from, the
top languages these users have

692
00:42:51.556 --> 00:42:53.976 A:middle
on their devices as well

693
00:42:53.976 --> 00:42:56.176 A:middle
as the top iTunes
preferences of these users.

694
00:42:56.176 --> 00:42:58.906 A:middle
So you know what are the things
they really like to download.

695
00:42:59.316 --> 00:43:02.086 A:middle
Now once you have
these unique insights,

696
00:43:03.416 --> 00:43:05.566 A:middle
you can take some
very tangible actions.

697
00:43:06.256 --> 00:43:12.026 A:middle
If you know the demographics of
your audience in the segment,

698
00:43:13.066 --> 00:43:17.416 A:middle
you can fine tune your app to
suit more of the demographics.

699
00:43:18.806 --> 00:43:23.556 A:middle
If you know the top regions and
the languages of your audience,

700
00:43:24.526 --> 00:43:27.136 A:middle
you might want to consider
localizing your app.

701
00:43:27.976 --> 00:43:30.736 A:middle
If you have an English
app and you know

702
00:43:30.736 --> 00:43:33.176 A:middle
that the top region
is Asia Pacific

703
00:43:33.176 --> 00:43:37.626 A:middle
and the top language is
Japanese, you might want

704
00:43:37.626 --> 00:43:39.126 A:middle
to make a Japanese app.

705
00:43:39.186 --> 00:43:42.126 A:middle
If you created a segment
of all your loyal users,

706
00:43:42.816 --> 00:43:45.756 A:middle
now you understand
the characteristics

707
00:43:45.756 --> 00:43:46.606 A:middle
of those audience.

708
00:43:47.946 --> 00:43:51.676 A:middle
And then using Workbench
targeting, you can find more

709
00:43:51.676 --> 00:43:55.096 A:middle
of the same and you can
build your audience pool.

710
00:43:55.766 --> 00:43:58.176 A:middle
And finally, with
audience segmentation

711
00:43:58.926 --> 00:44:00.596 A:middle
and audience targeting together,

712
00:44:01.786 --> 00:44:03.966 A:middle
we can bring you
another big thing

713
00:44:04.656 --> 00:44:06.266 A:middle
which we are also
introducing this fall

714
00:44:06.806 --> 00:44:09.476 A:middle
and we call it Audience
Retargeting.

715
00:44:09.826 --> 00:44:15.786 A:middle
Audience retargeting lets you
re-engage with every segment

716
00:44:15.786 --> 00:44:17.916 A:middle
that you have in
a customized way

717
00:44:18.176 --> 00:44:19.766 A:middle
so you can give a
custom experience

718
00:44:20.436 --> 00:44:21.506 A:middle
through each of your segments.

719
00:44:23.056 --> 00:44:25.306 A:middle
So now when you have
those dormant users

720
00:44:25.306 --> 00:44:28.916 A:middle
who didn't use your
app, you can re-engage

721
00:44:28.916 --> 00:44:30.856 A:middle
with those users
with that segment.

722
00:44:31.566 --> 00:44:34.626 A:middle
Show them a custom message,
motivate them to come back

723
00:44:34.626 --> 00:44:35.526 A:middle
and try your app again.

724
00:44:36.026 --> 00:44:40.966 A:middle
And when you have users who
have reached a certain level

725
00:44:41.216 --> 00:44:43.026 A:middle
and you want to push
them to the next level,

726
00:44:44.096 --> 00:44:46.946 A:middle
you can create a
segment of the users

727
00:44:46.946 --> 00:44:48.746 A:middle
who have reached say level 2.

728
00:44:48.996 --> 00:44:51.946 A:middle
Show them a custom
message about level 3.

729
00:44:52.706 --> 00:44:56.306 A:middle
When they engage with
that, take them to level 3,

730
00:44:57.306 --> 00:45:01.886 A:middle
not open the app, deep link
them directly to level 3.

731
00:45:02.336 --> 00:45:05.706 A:middle
And those users who
had an abundant cart

732
00:45:05.706 --> 00:45:08.976 A:middle
in your retail app,
you can now re-engage

733
00:45:09.136 --> 00:45:12.156 A:middle
or retarget those
users irrespective

734
00:45:12.156 --> 00:45:17.216 A:middle
of what device they are on and
bring them back to your app.

735
00:45:17.976 --> 00:45:23.176 A:middle
And not only bring them
back, deep link them directly

736
00:45:23.666 --> 00:45:24.486 A:middle
to the shopping basket,

737
00:45:25.396 --> 00:45:30.256 A:middle
so in the next step they
can finish the purchase.

738
00:45:30.356 --> 00:45:31.786 A:middle
So really anything is possible.

739
00:45:32.586 --> 00:45:37.046 A:middle
For each of your segments, you
can create that awesome message

740
00:45:37.936 --> 00:45:40.746 A:middle
and take the user to
wherever you want in the app

741
00:45:41.306 --> 00:45:42.366 A:middle
or even to any website.

742
00:45:43.346 --> 00:45:45.096 A:middle
Now that's not it.

743
00:45:46.066 --> 00:45:49.656 A:middle
With audience retargeting,
we'll actually find those users

744
00:45:49.656 --> 00:45:52.756 A:middle
for you on any iOS device.

745
00:45:54.696 --> 00:45:58.106 A:middle
So now when you had that example
but you introduce your iPad app,

746
00:45:58.536 --> 00:46:03.736 A:middle
a new app, now you can
find you iPhone app users

747
00:46:04.976 --> 00:46:06.096 A:middle
when they're on the iPad.

748
00:46:06.546 --> 00:46:11.326 A:middle
So what we are introducing
here is a cross-app,

749
00:46:12.726 --> 00:46:14.656 A:middle
cross-device retargeting.

750
00:46:15.706 --> 00:46:16.656 A:middle
That is huge.

751
00:46:18.556 --> 00:46:20.726 A:middle
What else is unique about this?

752
00:46:20.976 --> 00:46:24.186 A:middle
The first thing is
automation that comes with it.

753
00:46:25.036 --> 00:46:28.536 A:middle
When you build segments
using iOS 8,

754
00:46:29.296 --> 00:46:32.056 A:middle
your segments are automatically
updated in real-time.

755
00:46:33.396 --> 00:46:38.126 A:middle
No more of manually harvesting
idea phase, sharing them

756
00:46:38.126 --> 00:46:39.026 A:middle
with your network partners.

757
00:46:40.546 --> 00:46:43.716 A:middle
Your data is most secure
when it's in one place.

758
00:46:43.716 --> 00:46:47.536 A:middle
And there's no better
place than Apple iAd.

759
00:46:47.536 --> 00:46:51.266 A:middle
When you create segments this
way, segmentation is automated,

760
00:46:52.106 --> 00:46:54.786 A:middle
audience insights run
based on segmentation,

761
00:46:55.616 --> 00:46:58.206 A:middle
that's real-time updated as well

762
00:46:58.206 --> 00:47:01.606 A:middle
as the audience retargeting
is updated in real-time.

763
00:47:02.906 --> 00:47:06.406 A:middle
The next thing is Privacy.

764
00:47:06.406 --> 00:47:09.606 A:middle
Audience retargeting and this
entire solution we talked

765
00:47:09.606 --> 00:47:12.646 A:middle
about is deeply integrated
with iOS.

766
00:47:13.436 --> 00:47:15.576 A:middle
So you get all the benefits

767
00:47:15.706 --> 00:47:18.136 A:middle
of the built-in privacy
controls that come with it.

768
00:47:18.576 --> 00:47:21.726 A:middle
The solution complies with
the Limit Ad Tracking.

769
00:47:22.466 --> 00:47:26.496 A:middle
So now if you have a user
who has Limit Ad Tracking on,

770
00:47:26.966 --> 00:47:30.256 A:middle
that user is removed
automatically from the segments.

771
00:47:31.346 --> 00:47:33.006 A:middle
So the user is not retargeted.

772
00:47:34.346 --> 00:47:35.476 A:middle
Everything is automated.

773
00:47:36.306 --> 00:47:37.396 A:middle
You have nothing to worry about.

774
00:47:37.836 --> 00:47:42.756 A:middle
So with Audience
Segmentation, Audience Insights,

775
00:47:43.316 --> 00:47:45.516 A:middle
and Audience Retargeting,

776
00:47:46.166 --> 00:47:50.186 A:middle
iAd becomes-iAd Workbench
becomes a complete solution.

777
00:47:51.256 --> 00:47:54.616 A:middle
You can, not only acquire
new users and new customers,

778
00:47:55.246 --> 00:47:59.566 A:middle
you can now understand your
existing users and re-engage

779
00:47:59.566 --> 00:48:01.336 A:middle
with them to grow your business.
