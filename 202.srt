00:00:12.516 --> 00:00:19.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

2
00:00:20.046 --> 00:00:22.466 A:middle
&gt;&gt; Thanks so much for coming
to What's New in Cocoa Touch.

3
00:00:23.236 --> 00:00:25.686 A:middle
It's really great to see
a packed house here today.

4
00:00:25.736 --> 00:00:28.666 A:middle
I know that we have a
lot of new attendees

5
00:00:29.136 --> 00:00:32.286 A:middle
in the house this week,
and so for those of you

6
00:00:32.286 --> 00:00:35.296 A:middle
who have never been to a
WWDC, who have never been

7
00:00:35.296 --> 00:00:37.426 A:middle
to a What's New in
Cocoa Touch talk,

8
00:00:37.916 --> 00:00:40.586 A:middle
this is really a great
opportunity for you

9
00:00:40.586 --> 00:00:44.126 A:middle
to get a taste of all of the
new things that we're releasing

10
00:00:44.126 --> 00:00:48.556 A:middle
in the SDK this year, and as
you know this is actually the

11
00:00:48.786 --> 00:00:52.086 A:middle
biggest SDK release
since the SDK itself.

12
00:00:52.086 --> 00:00:55.936 A:middle
So this WWDC is going
to be absolutely huge,

13
00:00:56.476 --> 00:00:59.196 A:middle
and this session is your
opportunity to get a taste

14
00:00:59.196 --> 00:01:02.126 A:middle
of those technologies, and
I'll be pointing throughout the

15
00:01:02.126 --> 00:01:04.275 A:middle
session and, again at
the end of the session,

16
00:01:04.596 --> 00:01:07.826 A:middle
to all of the other related
sessions to the technologies

17
00:01:07.826 --> 00:01:10.356 A:middle
that I'm talking about
so you can get an idea

18
00:01:10.546 --> 00:01:13.606 A:middle
of what other talks that you
want to see this week and one

19
00:01:13.606 --> 00:01:18.166 A:middle
of the labs you're going to want
to go to and that sort of thing.

20
00:01:18.376 --> 00:01:22.406 A:middle
So to begin, I want to
talk about this core idea

21
00:01:23.036 --> 00:01:27.146 A:middle
of what we've set up of
what iOS 8 is really all

22
00:01:27.146 --> 00:01:28.966 A:middle
about from the SDK perspective,

23
00:01:29.226 --> 00:01:31.296 A:middle
and that's this idea
of Adaptivity.

24
00:01:31.566 --> 00:01:34.936 A:middle
Adaptivity is going to
pervade everything that we do

25
00:01:34.936 --> 00:01:40.066 A:middle
in Cocoa Touch in iOS 8, and
adaptivity means several things.

26
00:01:41.086 --> 00:01:45.026 A:middle
On one hand, adaptivity
is a design philosophy.

27
00:01:45.286 --> 00:01:48.296 A:middle
It's a way of architecting
your app, and we're going

28
00:01:48.366 --> 00:01:53.156 A:middle
to give you an idea of how we
want apps to be built from now

29
00:01:53.156 --> 00:01:57.876 A:middle
on using a design philosophy
that encourages code reuse,

30
00:01:58.596 --> 00:02:04.836 A:middle
generic code that adapts from
context to context and is able

31
00:02:04.836 --> 00:02:08.966 A:middle
to go from devices like
iPhone and iPad seamlessly.

32
00:02:09.856 --> 00:02:13.446 A:middle
Additionally, adaptivity
encompasses a whole set

33
00:02:13.746 --> 00:02:18.616 A:middle
of things that we are providing
directly from UIKit to you.

34
00:02:19.106 --> 00:02:21.796 A:middle
Things like Adaptive
View Controllers.

35
00:02:22.486 --> 00:02:25.646 A:middle
Adaptive view controllers are
something that we have written

36
00:02:25.826 --> 00:02:30.126 A:middle
with the design philosophy of
adaptivity that when you use

37
00:02:30.126 --> 00:02:32.086 A:middle
in your app can allow
you to do things

38
00:02:32.086 --> 00:02:35.586 A:middle
like take a simple primary,

39
00:02:35.586 --> 00:02:38.796 A:middle
secondary view controller
pattern, have it on iPhone,

40
00:02:39.396 --> 00:02:43.316 A:middle
have the same code that puts
that on iPhone put on interface

41
00:02:43.316 --> 00:02:48.226 A:middle
that you'd expect on iPad and do
that without any device checks,

42
00:02:48.226 --> 00:02:51.736 A:middle
and it will all be the same
code running on both devices.

43
00:02:51.736 --> 00:02:52.766 A:middle
We'll show you how to do that.

44
00:02:53.126 --> 00:02:56.716 A:middle
Similarly we've taken the
philosophy of adaptivity

45
00:02:56.716 --> 00:03:00.366 A:middle
to view controller presentations
and we'll show you how

46
00:03:00.366 --> 00:03:02.536 A:middle
to build code that
presents something

47
00:03:02.536 --> 00:03:05.346 A:middle
like a full screen modal
view controller on iPhone

48
00:03:06.276 --> 00:03:09.926 A:middle
and something more appropriate
like a popover on iPad.

49
00:03:10.216 --> 00:03:12.246 A:middle
Again, without any
device-specific checks

50
00:03:12.516 --> 00:03:16.036 A:middle
because we're focusing
on reusable adaptive code

51
00:03:16.316 --> 00:03:20.986 A:middle
that is the theme of
Cocoa Touch on iOS 8.

52
00:03:21.996 --> 00:03:22.746 A:middle
Additionally, we're going

53
00:03:22.746 --> 00:03:26.336 A:middle
to be pushing a new
user interface concept

54
00:03:26.336 --> 00:03:30.446 A:middle
that we want all applications
to adopt and that's dynamic

55
00:03:30.446 --> 00:03:34.146 A:middle
or dynamic text and
adapting to dynamic text.

56
00:03:34.726 --> 00:03:37.956 A:middle
This was actually a feature
that was introduced in iOS 7

57
00:03:38.786 --> 00:03:41.016 A:middle
that users can change
their preferred text size.

58
00:03:41.526 --> 00:03:45.476 A:middle
In iOS 8, we've extended the
idea such that all apps built

59
00:03:45.476 --> 00:03:50.386 A:middle
into iOS respond to dynamic
type and are adaptive to that,

60
00:03:50.386 --> 00:03:53.296 A:middle
and we want to show you
how you can do that.

61
00:03:53.296 --> 00:03:56.376 A:middle
We recognize that one
of the common places

62
00:03:56.376 --> 00:04:00.116 A:middle
that users interact with
text is actually in lists

63
00:04:00.116 --> 00:04:01.336 A:middle
in the form of table views.

64
00:04:01.636 --> 00:04:04.956 A:middle
So we took it upon
ourselves to make it easier

65
00:04:05.146 --> 00:04:07.916 A:middle
to take a simple table like
what you would see in settings,

66
00:04:08.436 --> 00:04:11.116 A:middle
respond to the user's
dynamic text choice,

67
00:04:11.606 --> 00:04:16.236 A:middle
make the text bigger, and
make the rows bigger as well.

68
00:04:16.426 --> 00:04:20.406 A:middle
Finally, adaptivity
refers to the ability,

69
00:04:20.546 --> 00:04:24.006 A:middle
this opportunity actually
to extend the system,

70
00:04:24.256 --> 00:04:28.186 A:middle
to adapt the system to your
user's needs and desires

71
00:04:28.186 --> 00:04:31.736 A:middle
by bringing your functionality
into system apps as well

72
00:04:31.736 --> 00:04:32.866 A:middle
as other third-party apps.

73
00:04:32.866 --> 00:04:34.516 A:middle
We saw in the keynote
that we can do things

74
00:04:34.886 --> 00:04:38.056 A:middle
like add a photo filter
right within the Photos app

75
00:04:38.306 --> 00:04:40.546 A:middle
without ever having to
go to your application.

76
00:04:41.406 --> 00:04:44.116 A:middle
So these are the kind of things
that we're going to be talking

77
00:04:44.116 --> 00:04:45.136 A:middle
about throughout the talk.

78
00:04:45.406 --> 00:04:49.446 A:middle
The first part is particularly
about the design philosophy,

79
00:04:50.236 --> 00:04:53.706 A:middle
and then we'll move into
listing off a lot of the things

80
00:04:53.756 --> 00:04:55.726 A:middle
that are especially
new about the API.

81
00:04:57.096 --> 00:04:58.586 A:middle
So to begin, we'll talk

82
00:04:58.586 --> 00:05:01.696 A:middle
about this design
philosophy of Adaptive Layout.

83
00:05:01.696 --> 00:05:07.226 A:middle
So, I said it before
but I'll say it again,

84
00:05:07.226 --> 00:05:08.236 A:middle
the key of what we mean

85
00:05:08.236 --> 00:05:12.306 A:middle
by adaptive layout is
something that is reusable.

86
00:05:12.436 --> 00:05:14.246 A:middle
A bit of code that is generic,

87
00:05:14.506 --> 00:05:16.756 A:middle
that transcends device
boundaries

88
00:05:17.036 --> 00:05:18.676 A:middle
and orientation boundaries.

89
00:05:18.676 --> 00:05:21.986 A:middle
So the first thing we want to
talk about is the simple idea

90
00:05:22.226 --> 00:05:23.926 A:middle
of interface orientation.

91
00:05:24.916 --> 00:05:28.776 A:middle
This has been a stalwart
concept through the API

92
00:05:29.136 --> 00:05:32.886 A:middle
since the SDK was introduced,
and we actually want to move now

93
00:05:33.176 --> 00:05:35.846 A:middle
to a place where when
we're writing our apps,

94
00:05:35.846 --> 00:05:37.286 A:middle
our layout code doesn't have

95
00:05:37.356 --> 00:05:40.406 A:middle
to care what the interface
orientation is and that's going

96
00:05:40.406 --> 00:05:42.216 A:middle
to be the theme of what
we're talking about now.

97
00:05:42.856 --> 00:05:46.096 A:middle
So we can imagine that a
designer gave us a design

98
00:05:46.096 --> 00:05:50.516 A:middle
for a Photos app, and they
say, okay, this Photos app

99
00:05:50.886 --> 00:05:54.456 A:middle
on portrait in an
iPad looks like a grid

100
00:05:54.456 --> 00:05:56.706 A:middle
of rectangular thumbnail photos

101
00:05:57.266 --> 00:05:58.876 A:middle
and there's five
columns in that grid.

102
00:05:59.756 --> 00:06:02.776 A:middle
Similarly, they give us the
spec and say, if that iPad is

103
00:06:02.776 --> 00:06:06.716 A:middle
in landscape, show us similar,
show similar thumbnails

104
00:06:06.996 --> 00:06:08.166 A:middle
but seven columns of them.

105
00:06:08.806 --> 00:06:12.386 A:middle
Now, the naive way to
approach this would be, okay,

106
00:06:12.836 --> 00:06:17.186 A:middle
let's hard code in five
columns of things for portrait

107
00:06:17.726 --> 00:06:20.836 A:middle
and seven columns of
things for landscape.

108
00:06:21.576 --> 00:06:26.846 A:middle
But to become adaptive, we want
to take a deeper understanding

109
00:06:26.916 --> 00:06:29.666 A:middle
of why we have five
columns in portrait

110
00:06:29.666 --> 00:06:32.576 A:middle
and why we have seven
columns in landscape.

111
00:06:33.336 --> 00:06:36.156 A:middle
It's pretty easy to
understand with this example

112
00:06:36.156 --> 00:06:41.256 A:middle
that the reason is the portrait
view is 768 points wide,

113
00:06:41.926 --> 00:06:44.616 A:middle
and based on the thumbnail
size that we want to achieve,

114
00:06:44.616 --> 00:06:46.876 A:middle
it just so happens
that we can fit five

115
00:06:46.876 --> 00:06:49.556 A:middle
across so we have five columns.

116
00:06:50.656 --> 00:06:52.876 A:middle
Similarly when we
go to landscape,

117
00:06:53.046 --> 00:06:56.586 A:middle
we now have 1024 points
in the width dimension,

118
00:06:56.956 --> 00:07:00.846 A:middle
and based on the thumbnail
size that we wanted to achieve,

119
00:07:00.846 --> 00:07:02.546 A:middle
we can now fit seven columns.

120
00:07:03.456 --> 00:07:07.246 A:middle
The difference here is that when
we take that logic that we say,

121
00:07:07.246 --> 00:07:11.726 A:middle
okay, we can fit this many
columns in this space as opposed

122
00:07:11.726 --> 00:07:14.246 A:middle
to there are seven columns

123
00:07:14.246 --> 00:07:19.316 A:middle
in landscape then the actual
interface orientation is not a

124
00:07:19.316 --> 00:07:22.746 A:middle
relevant thing in determining
what your layout looks

125
00:07:22.746 --> 00:07:23.416 A:middle
like anymore.

126
00:07:23.876 --> 00:07:27.026 A:middle
All that matters is what
the canvas size looks like.

127
00:07:28.436 --> 00:07:32.116 A:middle
So there's also another decision
being made under the hood here

128
00:07:32.116 --> 00:07:33.776 A:middle
if we just sort of
focus in on this view,

129
00:07:34.306 --> 00:07:39.856 A:middle
and that's we've made
these rectangular spread

130
00:07:39.856 --> 00:07:42.096 A:middle
out thumbnails, but
the Photos app

131
00:07:42.096 --> 00:07:45.496 A:middle
on the iPhone has actually
much more compacted thumbnails

132
00:07:45.496 --> 00:07:46.596 A:middle
that are square in shape.

133
00:07:47.066 --> 00:07:48.266 A:middle
And the reason it's that way

134
00:07:48.266 --> 00:07:50.786 A:middle
on the iPhone is a very
similar vein reason.

135
00:07:51.036 --> 00:07:53.746 A:middle
It's because the size of
the iPhone is different.

136
00:07:54.366 --> 00:07:59.376 A:middle
And so, we compact the layout
when we are in a compacted size,

137
00:08:00.416 --> 00:08:04.426 A:middle
and so we can actually
think about that decision,

138
00:08:04.426 --> 00:08:07.286 A:middle
the compacted iPhone style
layout versus what you see

139
00:08:07.286 --> 00:08:08.316 A:middle
up here-the more spread

140
00:08:08.316 --> 00:08:12.106 A:middle
out rectangular thumbnail
layout-as also being determined

141
00:08:12.106 --> 00:08:14.276 A:middle
by the size and not
actually based

142
00:08:14.276 --> 00:08:16.636 A:middle
on a device, iPhone versus iPad.

143
00:08:17.146 --> 00:08:19.786 A:middle
So we're now going to begin
to think of this interface

144
00:08:19.836 --> 00:08:25.176 A:middle
as determined by the idea that
it has regular-sized dimensions.

145
00:08:25.646 --> 00:08:28.486 A:middle
The height is regular;
the width is regular.

146
00:08:29.466 --> 00:08:33.466 A:middle
And we're thinking of this
semantic-based sizing idea

147
00:08:33.876 --> 00:08:36.846 A:middle
as a new thing that
we call Size Classes.

148
00:08:37.765 --> 00:08:41.556 A:middle
Size classes are a
very simple enumeration

149
00:08:42.186 --> 00:08:44.956 A:middle
that gets us thinking
about canvas size

150
00:08:44.956 --> 00:08:48.626 A:middle
when we do layouts rather
than interface orientation.

151
00:08:50.386 --> 00:08:54.116 A:middle
We have independent horizontal
and vertical size classes,

152
00:08:54.116 --> 00:08:58.716 A:middle
and either one of these axis can
be either compact or regular.

153
00:08:58.816 --> 00:09:01.966 A:middle
And that simple choice
can allow us to choose

154
00:09:01.966 --> 00:09:04.816 A:middle
between what we may now think
of as an iPhone style interface

155
00:09:05.116 --> 00:09:06.766 A:middle
and an iPad style interface.

156
00:09:07.156 --> 00:09:08.656 A:middle
It really isn't about
the device.

157
00:09:08.716 --> 00:09:11.256 A:middle
It's about the canvas
size that we have.

158
00:09:11.476 --> 00:09:12.726 A:middle
And we'll continue to talk

159
00:09:12.726 --> 00:09:16.506 A:middle
about this idea throughout the
session, but part of what makes

160
00:09:16.506 --> 00:09:20.706 A:middle
that key is that you may
end up in a situation

161
00:09:20.706 --> 00:09:24.366 A:middle
where you are showing
something, displaying your view

162
00:09:24.366 --> 00:09:27.906 A:middle
on say an iPad where the size

163
00:09:27.906 --> 00:09:31.486 A:middle
of that canvas is actually
comparable to that of just being

164
00:09:31.486 --> 00:09:35.196 A:middle
on an iPhone, and if
you've written adaptive code

165
00:09:35.586 --> 00:09:38.766 A:middle
that simply uses the size
rather than the device

166
00:09:38.856 --> 00:09:42.206 A:middle
to do its layout, you'll
get an iPhone style layout

167
00:09:42.206 --> 00:09:46.296 A:middle
when appropriate in
smaller spaces on an iPad.

168
00:09:46.296 --> 00:09:48.936 A:middle
So, the situations that
we can end up in are

169
00:09:48.936 --> 00:09:51.416 A:middle
on the iPad having regular
height and regular width.

170
00:09:51.416 --> 00:09:52.816 A:middle
This is true in either
orientation.

171
00:09:53.786 --> 00:09:58.256 A:middle
On the iPhone, the width becomes
compacted and using that bit

172
00:09:58.256 --> 00:10:00.816 A:middle
of information, the Photos
app can choose to shrink

173
00:10:00.816 --> 00:10:05.286 A:middle
to its more compacted square
thumbnail-based layout.

174
00:10:05.656 --> 00:10:08.426 A:middle
Similarly, when the
iPhone goes to landscape,

175
00:10:08.696 --> 00:10:12.256 A:middle
it still has a compact width but
also takes on a compact height.

176
00:10:12.956 --> 00:10:15.076 A:middle
So you can use both of
those pieces of information

177
00:10:15.356 --> 00:10:19.886 A:middle
to decide what happens in
your layout in your app.

178
00:10:20.106 --> 00:10:23.646 A:middle
So, we've wrapped up this
concept of size classes

179
00:10:23.886 --> 00:10:26.636 A:middle
and are exposing it
to you via a new class

180
00:10:26.636 --> 00:10:28.936 A:middle
in UIKit called UI
Trait Collection.

181
00:10:30.006 --> 00:10:33.116 A:middle
UI trait collection is a
handy bringing together

182
00:10:33.116 --> 00:10:34.966 A:middle
of a few pieces of
information including the

183
00:10:35.016 --> 00:10:37.956 A:middle
horizontalSizeClass,
the verticalSizeClass,

184
00:10:38.486 --> 00:10:41.856 A:middle
the displayScale, and
the userInterfaceIdiom.

185
00:10:42.626 --> 00:10:46.666 A:middle
Now what makes trait collections
convenient is they're hung right

186
00:10:46.736 --> 00:10:48.806 A:middle
as a property on
UIViewController.

187
00:10:48.806 --> 00:10:50.996 A:middle
So you can access them
from your view controller.

188
00:10:50.996 --> 00:10:55.276 A:middle
You can also get them from the
current screen, and then using

189
00:10:55.276 --> 00:10:57.416 A:middle
that information, you
have your size class.

190
00:10:57.846 --> 00:10:59.306 A:middle
You can make the determination

191
00:10:59.526 --> 00:11:01.656 A:middle
of what is the right
thing to do for you.

192
00:11:01.916 --> 00:11:04.746 A:middle
So as a simple example, we can
think of what we did with Photos

193
00:11:05.306 --> 00:11:09.966 A:middle
and implement a size
class did change method.

194
00:11:10.516 --> 00:11:12.996 A:middle
And for Photos, it just needs

195
00:11:12.996 --> 00:11:17.036 A:middle
to consider what the
new size class is,

196
00:11:17.616 --> 00:11:21.886 A:middle
and based on whether the
horizontalSizeClass is compact

197
00:11:21.946 --> 00:11:24.536 A:middle
or not, the Photos
layout chooses

198
00:11:24.856 --> 00:11:28.486 A:middle
to use either its compact
squares-based layout,

199
00:11:28.786 --> 00:11:31.496 A:middle
if it is a compact
horizontalSizeClass,

200
00:11:32.066 --> 00:11:36.336 A:middle
or otherwise it uses its
rectangular thumbnail,

201
00:11:36.336 --> 00:11:37.956 A:middle
more spread out layout.

202
00:11:38.536 --> 00:11:41.706 A:middle
And then this particular
snippet is modeled to be

203
00:11:41.706 --> 00:11:44.526 A:middle
on a collection view
controller, so it just takes

204
00:11:44.526 --> 00:11:48.186 A:middle
that layout object and applies
it to its collection view

205
00:11:48.436 --> 00:11:50.946 A:middle
as a new layout object.

206
00:11:51.046 --> 00:11:54.426 A:middle
Now, some of you may be
noticing this unfamiliar scribe

207
00:11:54.476 --> 00:11:55.636 A:middle
to you on the screen.

208
00:11:56.546 --> 00:11:59.626 A:middle
If this is your first time
seeing Swift, congratulations.

209
00:11:59.696 --> 00:12:04.466 A:middle
Here is your intro, and you
can see just how easy it is

210
00:12:04.466 --> 00:12:05.536 A:middle
to understand.

211
00:12:05.956 --> 00:12:08.926 A:middle
And this will give you
an idea of how easy it is

212
00:12:09.116 --> 00:12:10.886 A:middle
to start adopting
Swift immediately

213
00:12:10.886 --> 00:12:13.116 A:middle
with all Cocoa and
Cocoa Touch APIs.

214
00:12:14.486 --> 00:12:18.456 A:middle
So with that, I'll talk
about quickly another new API

215
00:12:18.646 --> 00:12:21.006 A:middle
that we've added to
support your layout

216
00:12:21.306 --> 00:12:23.516 A:middle
in iOS 8, which is Margins.

217
00:12:24.226 --> 00:12:28.946 A:middle
So margins coincide with
an API release in iOS 7,

218
00:12:28.946 --> 00:12:29.826 A:middle
which is layout guides.

219
00:12:30.946 --> 00:12:34.756 A:middle
Layout guides help you know
about hard lines on the screen.

220
00:12:34.756 --> 00:12:37.526 A:middle
In this case, the top and
the bottom of the screen,

221
00:12:37.526 --> 00:12:40.036 A:middle
where the top is denoting
there's a navigation bar there.

222
00:12:40.376 --> 00:12:43.626 A:middle
So the layout guide tells
you about that navigation bar

223
00:12:43.626 --> 00:12:45.466 A:middle
in case you'd like to avoid it.

224
00:12:45.626 --> 00:12:47.376 A:middle
If there was a toolbar at
the bottom of the screen,

225
00:12:47.376 --> 00:12:50.246 A:middle
your layout guide would also
denote the top of that toolbar.

226
00:12:50.246 --> 00:12:52.056 A:middle
In this case, it just
denotes the hard line

227
00:12:52.466 --> 00:12:53.776 A:middle
that is the bottom
of the screen.

228
00:12:54.256 --> 00:12:58.576 A:middle
But there's another concept
in this UI that isn't covered

229
00:12:58.576 --> 00:13:02.796 A:middle
by layout guides and that is
the whitespace that is inset

230
00:13:02.796 --> 00:13:04.576 A:middle
in the content from the
edges of the screen.

231
00:13:04.976 --> 00:13:08.526 A:middle
So, in iOS 8, we're
introducing an API on UIView,

232
00:13:08.926 --> 00:13:12.826 A:middle
which is layout guides which
tells you about that whitespace

233
00:13:12.826 --> 00:13:15.866 A:middle
and allows you to set
whatever whitespace you want

234
00:13:15.866 --> 00:13:16.526 A:middle
for your layout.

235
00:13:16.526 --> 00:13:18.186 A:middle
So that's a property on UIView.

236
00:13:18.516 --> 00:13:22.246 A:middle
It also comes with native
support for autolayout,

237
00:13:22.336 --> 00:13:25.136 A:middle
and that's in the form of
new NS layout attributes,

238
00:13:25.136 --> 00:13:30.346 A:middle
including left, right,
leading, trailing, et cetera.

239
00:13:30.346 --> 00:13:31.166 A:middle
There's a bunch of these.

240
00:13:31.366 --> 00:13:33.566 A:middle
If you've been using
autolayout in your code,

241
00:13:33.566 --> 00:13:35.886 A:middle
you'll find this
natural and familiar.

242
00:13:37.366 --> 00:13:40.916 A:middle
So, to learn more tricks about
building adaptive layout apps,

243
00:13:41.016 --> 00:13:43.416 A:middle
there's going to be
a great talk tomorrow

244
00:13:43.416 --> 00:13:46.636 A:middle
in the Mission called Building
Adaptive Apps with UIKit.

245
00:13:48.206 --> 00:13:50.926 A:middle
So now I'm going to be moving
on to talking about some

246
00:13:50.926 --> 00:13:54.636 A:middle
of the ways that we have
adopted the philosophy

247
00:13:54.946 --> 00:13:59.656 A:middle
of adaptive size class-based
design to build things

248
00:13:59.656 --> 00:14:02.976 A:middle
that you can use out of
the box that are adaptive

249
00:14:03.166 --> 00:14:05.136 A:middle
without you having
to do any work.

250
00:14:05.736 --> 00:14:08.756 A:middle
So we'll start by talking about
Adaptive View Controllers.

251
00:14:08.756 --> 00:14:09.816 A:middle
This is a great new feature.

252
00:14:11.296 --> 00:14:14.236 A:middle
And to begin to dive into this,
I'm actually going to go back

253
00:14:14.236 --> 00:14:18.706 A:middle
and talk a little bit more about
this idea of orientation which,

254
00:14:18.816 --> 00:14:20.236 A:middle
or rotation, which we touched

255
00:14:20.776 --> 00:14:24.126 A:middle
on with the orientation
segment of the talk.

256
00:14:24.766 --> 00:14:26.776 A:middle
So, now I'm going
to have us kind

257
00:14:26.946 --> 00:14:31.696 A:middle
of ask ourselves this question,
what is rotation, really?

258
00:14:32.106 --> 00:14:35.316 A:middle
Because asking ourselves
that question yields a result

259
00:14:35.316 --> 00:14:37.156 A:middle
that helps us write
adaptive code.

260
00:14:37.696 --> 00:14:42.896 A:middle
And that result is, it's
just an animated change

261
00:14:42.896 --> 00:14:44.326 A:middle
of the size of the view.

262
00:14:45.366 --> 00:14:49.236 A:middle
So, if we consider a
view that's onscreen,

263
00:14:50.546 --> 00:14:54.306 A:middle
we might have been thinking
of when the device rotates,

264
00:14:54.806 --> 00:14:59.656 A:middle
that view rotates with it
and this is a rotating view.

265
00:15:00.816 --> 00:15:05.156 A:middle
That perspective actually
complicates the idea

266
00:15:05.156 --> 00:15:07.276 A:middle
of what we have to
do in our layout.

267
00:15:07.826 --> 00:15:11.016 A:middle
And so, beginning in iOS
8 we're encouraging you

268
00:15:11.016 --> 00:15:14.776 A:middle
to take a different perspective
towards how rotation works,

269
00:15:15.176 --> 00:15:19.086 A:middle
which is just think of it as
a view that happens to have,

270
00:15:19.636 --> 00:15:22.376 A:middle
in this case, a regular
height and a compact width,

271
00:15:23.136 --> 00:15:26.956 A:middle
and when the device rotates,
something happens to that view.

272
00:15:27.306 --> 00:15:28.546 A:middle
And the thing that happens

273
00:15:28.546 --> 00:15:32.066 A:middle
to that view is it undergoes
an animated size change,

274
00:15:32.546 --> 00:15:36.526 A:middle
and perhaps it goes to a compact
height and a regular width.

275
00:15:36.526 --> 00:15:41.986 A:middle
I don't want to confuse you
in that standard on an iPhone

276
00:15:42.776 --> 00:15:44.836 A:middle
in landscape, the width
is actually compact,

277
00:15:45.316 --> 00:15:47.026 A:middle
but this is an illustrative
example

278
00:15:47.206 --> 00:15:48.756 A:middle
of what might happen
to your view.

279
00:15:48.756 --> 00:15:52.936 A:middle
As your view changes size,
it can go to any new size

280
00:15:52.936 --> 00:15:53.876 A:middle
and any new size class,

281
00:15:53.876 --> 00:15:55.456 A:middle
and that's really
all that's happening

282
00:15:55.816 --> 00:15:58.176 A:middle
when you're undergoing
a rotation.

283
00:15:58.556 --> 00:16:00.446 A:middle
And part of the advantage
of thinking

284
00:16:00.446 --> 00:16:04.586 A:middle
about rotations this way
is merely as size change is

285
00:16:04.586 --> 00:16:08.656 A:middle
that once you handle
rotations as size changes,

286
00:16:09.366 --> 00:16:11.866 A:middle
any other situation
that you might end up in

287
00:16:12.096 --> 00:16:15.166 A:middle
where your size changes,
you will have handled

288
00:16:15.976 --> 00:16:18.666 A:middle
because you will have
written your code in a way

289
00:16:18.666 --> 00:16:20.996 A:middle
that it can handle size
changes especially those

290
00:16:21.286 --> 00:16:21.996 A:middle
that are animated.

291
00:16:22.606 --> 00:16:26.596 A:middle
So in order to move in this new
direction, we're taking a lot

292
00:16:26.596 --> 00:16:31.236 A:middle
of API that used to exist in
iOS 7 while it still exists

293
00:16:31.236 --> 00:16:34.136 A:middle
in iOS 8, but we're
deprecating it.

294
00:16:34.346 --> 00:16:36.986 A:middle
This is just a subset
of the rotation API

295
00:16:36.986 --> 00:16:38.906 A:middle
that is deprecated in iOS 8.

296
00:16:39.516 --> 00:16:45.616 A:middle
[ Applause ]

297
00:16:46.116 --> 00:16:49.576 A:middle
And what I really like is what
we're replacing this with.

298
00:16:50.046 --> 00:16:52.136 A:middle
Thinking about things
as size changes,

299
00:16:52.866 --> 00:16:54.626 A:middle
you can just implement
one method.

300
00:16:55.376 --> 00:16:56.766 A:middle
We'll transition to size.

301
00:16:57.866 --> 00:17:00.036 A:middle
And since that takes a
transition coordinator,

302
00:17:00.386 --> 00:17:02.566 A:middle
if there's interesting things
you want to do-if you want

303
00:17:02.656 --> 00:17:05.516 A:middle
to animate along with that size
change whether it be rotation

304
00:17:05.516 --> 00:17:07.786 A:middle
or anything else
that changes the size

305
00:17:08.046 --> 00:17:12.476 A:middle
of your view controller-you can
use that transition coordinator

306
00:17:12.836 --> 00:17:15.266 A:middle
to do an animation, and
you just send in a block

307
00:17:15.665 --> 00:17:17.766 A:middle
with that transition coordinator

308
00:17:17.945 --> 00:17:20.465 A:middle
and those changes
will be animated along

309
00:17:20.465 --> 00:17:23.066 A:middle
with the size change,
which may be a rotation

310
00:17:23.376 --> 00:17:24.136 A:middle
of your view controller.

311
00:17:24.136 --> 00:17:26.576 A:middle
So in this case, I've
used the size change

312
00:17:26.796 --> 00:17:28.636 A:middle
to simply change the
number of columns

313
00:17:28.856 --> 00:17:32.116 A:middle
in my photo layout
based on the new size.

314
00:17:33.836 --> 00:17:39.416 A:middle
So beyond just view controllers
themselves with rotation,

315
00:17:39.666 --> 00:17:42.666 A:middle
we've built some view
controllers that allow you

316
00:17:42.766 --> 00:17:47.416 A:middle
to adapt to the hierarchy
from device to device in a way

317
00:17:47.416 --> 00:17:49.376 A:middle
that makes it so that
you write less code.

318
00:17:51.056 --> 00:17:52.766 A:middle
And so, many of you have
probably written something

319
00:17:52.766 --> 00:17:55.476 A:middle
like you see on the
screen, a primary,

320
00:17:55.476 --> 00:17:57.406 A:middle
secondary view controller
pattern

321
00:17:57.406 --> 00:17:59.676 A:middle
and you do this using a
split view controller,

322
00:18:00.446 --> 00:18:02.986 A:middle
and then you embed a
navigation controller

323
00:18:03.346 --> 00:18:07.556 A:middle
as the master view controller
of that split view controller.

324
00:18:08.286 --> 00:18:11.266 A:middle
And then when you would go and
take this same design pattern

325
00:18:11.266 --> 00:18:14.056 A:middle
of a primary, secondary view
controller, you would end

326
00:18:14.056 --> 00:18:17.206 A:middle
up on the iPhone with
a navigation controller

327
00:18:17.276 --> 00:18:18.556 A:middle
as your view controller,

328
00:18:19.066 --> 00:18:23.266 A:middle
and that meant you would have
a device idiom check saying,

329
00:18:23.436 --> 00:18:24.546 A:middle
am I on an iPad?

330
00:18:24.796 --> 00:18:27.486 A:middle
If so, build this view
controller hierarchy.

331
00:18:27.736 --> 00:18:31.086 A:middle
If not, build this other
view controller hierarchy

332
00:18:31.086 --> 00:18:33.406 A:middle
with a navigation
controller as an iPhone.

333
00:18:34.816 --> 00:18:37.506 A:middle
While on iPad just
as we want to make it

334
00:18:37.506 --> 00:18:38.676 A:middle
so that you no longer need

335
00:18:38.676 --> 00:18:43.266 A:middle
to care what your interface
orientation is, we also want

336
00:18:43.266 --> 00:18:44.696 A:middle
to make it so that
you no longer need

337
00:18:44.696 --> 00:18:47.516 A:middle
to care what your
interface idiom is.

338
00:18:47.856 --> 00:18:49.156 A:middle
And to do that we're making it

339
00:18:49.156 --> 00:18:51.086 A:middle
so that you can build this
interface on an iPhone

340
00:18:51.436 --> 00:18:54.466 A:middle
with the split view controller
as the root view controller.

341
00:18:55.526 --> 00:18:58.056 A:middle
And it will still contain
a navigation controller

342
00:18:58.406 --> 00:18:59.986 A:middle
as its master view controller.

343
00:19:00.516 --> 00:19:04.266 A:middle
Then when you want to, you
know, push another view

344
00:19:04.266 --> 00:19:06.956 A:middle
onto the stack, you can just
call show view controller

345
00:19:06.956 --> 00:19:07.336 A:middle
on this.

346
00:19:07.366 --> 00:19:08.946 A:middle
It will do exactly
what you would expect

347
00:19:09.066 --> 00:19:13.196 A:middle
from a navigation experience,
pushing a view onto the stack,

348
00:19:13.596 --> 00:19:15.916 A:middle
and when you would
execute something

349
00:19:15.916 --> 00:19:19.866 A:middle
that would be the equivalent
of showing a detail on iPad,

350
00:19:19.866 --> 00:19:22.166 A:middle
you can just call show
detail view controller.

351
00:19:22.576 --> 00:19:25.516 A:middle
And on the phone, it will do
exactly what you would expect a

352
00:19:25.576 --> 00:19:28.876 A:middle
phone interface to
do, which is push it

353
00:19:28.916 --> 00:19:30.456 A:middle
onto the navigation controller

354
00:19:30.456 --> 00:19:33.216 A:middle
because that's all that's
available on the phone.

355
00:19:33.576 --> 00:19:35.306 A:middle
But that same set of APIs,

356
00:19:35.606 --> 00:19:38.436 A:middle
that same call sequence
calling show view controller

357
00:19:38.566 --> 00:19:42.256 A:middle
and show detailed view
controller on iPad,

358
00:19:42.606 --> 00:19:46.656 A:middle
will yield what the user
would expect on iPad,

359
00:19:46.936 --> 00:19:48.366 A:middle
which is a detailed
view controller

360
00:19:48.656 --> 00:19:49.936 A:middle
over on the right
of the split view.

361
00:19:51.496 --> 00:19:54.796 A:middle
So, UISplitViewController
is really a workhorse

362
00:19:54.886 --> 00:19:56.626 A:middle
to be used in iOS 8.

363
00:19:57.166 --> 00:20:00.316 A:middle
The key to it is that it's
now available on all devices,

364
00:20:00.596 --> 00:20:02.976 A:middle
allowing you to build view
controller hierarchies

365
00:20:03.246 --> 00:20:05.596 A:middle
that don't depend on
what device you're on.

366
00:20:05.646 --> 00:20:08.946 A:middle
It's the same hierarchy
on iPad and iPhone,

367
00:20:09.646 --> 00:20:12.246 A:middle
and split view controller
will adapt for you.

368
00:20:12.696 --> 00:20:14.596 A:middle
So with that it handles
the primary,

369
00:20:14.596 --> 00:20:17.576 A:middle
secondary controller pattern
transparently for you,

370
00:20:17.876 --> 00:20:19.726 A:middle
and also to go along with this,

371
00:20:19.726 --> 00:20:23.646 A:middle
split view controller has
a whole host of new updates

372
00:20:23.646 --> 00:20:25.046 A:middle
to its API and its release.

373
00:20:25.046 --> 00:20:27.676 A:middle
I can't even begin to
talk about what they are.

374
00:20:27.906 --> 00:20:29.376 A:middle
If you'd like to
learn more about them,

375
00:20:29.376 --> 00:20:31.956 A:middle
there will be a great talk
tomorrow morning called View

376
00:20:31.956 --> 00:20:35.326 A:middle
Controller Advancements
in iOS 8.

377
00:20:36.046 --> 00:20:39.206 A:middle
So, moving on to
Adaptive Presentations.

378
00:20:39.526 --> 00:20:42.906 A:middle
This is another way that the
view controller system is

379
00:20:43.026 --> 00:20:48.276 A:middle
helping you have code that
is simple and device agnostic

380
00:20:49.116 --> 00:20:51.826 A:middle
but that does the right
thing on each device.

381
00:20:52.126 --> 00:20:54.116 A:middle
We want to help you
build something

382
00:20:54.116 --> 00:20:57.726 A:middle
like a full screen modal
presentation on iPhone

383
00:20:57.906 --> 00:21:00.606 A:middle
and get something more
appropriate like a form sheet

384
00:21:00.606 --> 00:21:05.766 A:middle
on iPad or even a popover,
and do this without code

385
00:21:05.766 --> 00:21:07.416 A:middle
that checks what
device you're on.

386
00:21:07.416 --> 00:21:09.726 A:middle
It'll be the same
code on every device.

387
00:21:11.126 --> 00:21:13.586 A:middle
So in particular, one thing

388
00:21:13.586 --> 00:21:18.296 A:middle
that is really changing
its paradigm is popovers.

389
00:21:19.206 --> 00:21:22.776 A:middle
Prior to iOS 8 popovers
were only available on iPad,

390
00:21:23.046 --> 00:21:26.136 A:middle
and we would use them in the
form of UI popover controller.

391
00:21:27.116 --> 00:21:29.476 A:middle
Well, that paradigm is
changing significantly

392
00:21:29.786 --> 00:21:31.976 A:middle
because we're now no
longer requiring the use

393
00:21:31.976 --> 00:21:34.306 A:middle
of UI popover controller
to present a popover.

394
00:21:35.316 --> 00:21:38.096 A:middle
Instead, popovers are
presented via the API

395
00:21:38.666 --> 00:21:42.976 A:middle
as a presentation style
for view controller.

396
00:21:43.516 --> 00:21:48.546 A:middle
[ Applause ]

397
00:21:49.046 --> 00:21:51.976 A:middle
So that means if you present
a popover or a view controller

398
00:21:51.976 --> 00:21:53.716 A:middle
with a popover presentation
style

399
00:21:54.056 --> 00:21:57.796 A:middle
and the presenting view
controller horizontalSizeClass

400
00:21:57.796 --> 00:21:59.736 A:middle
is regular, it would just appear

401
00:21:59.736 --> 00:22:02.356 A:middle
as you expect a popover
to appear.

402
00:22:02.786 --> 00:22:05.686 A:middle
With that same code using a
popover presentation style,

403
00:22:05.986 --> 00:22:07.626 A:middle
if the presenting view
controller is compact

404
00:22:08.356 --> 00:22:10.776 A:middle
in the horizontal dimension
like you would see on an iPhone,

405
00:22:11.176 --> 00:22:15.466 A:middle
it would just appear
as an oversheet

406
00:22:16.476 --> 00:22:19.406 A:middle
so that you get what you
would expect on iPhone.

407
00:22:20.066 --> 00:22:23.076 A:middle
So we're taking this,
these concepts,

408
00:22:23.076 --> 00:22:26.126 A:middle
and we're bringing adaptivity
to some other view controllers

409
00:22:26.126 --> 00:22:30.196 A:middle
that we ran like search results,
which you may be thinking, well,

410
00:22:30.196 --> 00:22:31.076 A:middle
that's not a view controller.

411
00:22:31.076 --> 00:22:34.886 A:middle
Well, we're fixing that because
UISearchDisplayController is

412
00:22:34.886 --> 00:22:37.156 A:middle
replaced by UISearchController,

413
00:22:37.886 --> 00:22:40.776 A:middle
and UISearchController is
crucially a view controller

414
00:22:40.776 --> 00:22:44.796 A:middle
subclass, and that means that
it can take advantage of all

415
00:22:44.796 --> 00:22:47.916 A:middle
of the power of adaptive
hierarchies and presentations

416
00:22:48.166 --> 00:22:49.416 A:middle
that we've just talked about.

417
00:22:49.646 --> 00:22:52.956 A:middle
That's all at your fingertips
with the new UISearchController.

418
00:22:54.226 --> 00:22:58.626 A:middle
This new UISearchController is
also able to be fully customized

419
00:22:58.686 --> 00:23:02.176 A:middle
in the way that its UI
appears and how it's presented

420
00:23:02.386 --> 00:23:05.156 A:middle
so that you can adapt
the search controller

421
00:23:05.156 --> 00:23:08.106 A:middle
into your application even if
you have a fully customized UI

422
00:23:08.666 --> 00:23:10.896 A:middle
like that in FaceTime,
it will look the way

423
00:23:10.896 --> 00:23:11.956 A:middle
that you want it to look.

424
00:23:12.716 --> 00:23:15.656 A:middle
We're doing something
similar with alerts in iOS 8,

425
00:23:16.036 --> 00:23:20.316 A:middle
and we're taking UIAlertView and
UIActionSheet and replacing them

426
00:23:20.526 --> 00:23:21.816 A:middle
with UIAlertController.

427
00:23:22.516 --> 00:23:27.686 A:middle
[ Applause ]

428
00:23:28.186 --> 00:23:30.586 A:middle
I kind of thought you
guys might like that one.

429
00:23:30.776 --> 00:23:33.976 A:middle
UIAlertController is also
a UIViewController subclass

430
00:23:33.976 --> 00:23:37.496 A:middle
so that we can internally
use all of the power

431
00:23:37.496 --> 00:23:41.696 A:middle
of adaptive presentations to our
advantage and to your advantage

432
00:23:41.836 --> 00:23:42.996 A:middle
so that things look great.

433
00:23:43.196 --> 00:23:46.266 A:middle
Of course, UIAlertController
adapts its styling

434
00:23:46.546 --> 00:23:50.196 A:middle
to the context so that when
you present it on an iPhone

435
00:23:50.646 --> 00:23:54.226 A:middle
or on anything that has a
compact horizontalSizeClass,

436
00:23:54.566 --> 00:23:56.746 A:middle
you get an action
sheet appearance.

437
00:23:56.746 --> 00:23:58.116 A:middle
You can get an alert
appearance also

438
00:23:58.116 --> 00:24:00.856 A:middle
but in the action sheet style,
you get something that looks

439
00:24:00.856 --> 00:24:02.856 A:middle
like what you expect an
action sheet to look like,

440
00:24:03.496 --> 00:24:06.876 A:middle
and the same code that presents
that action sheet on an iPhone,

441
00:24:08.006 --> 00:24:11.206 A:middle
in a regular horizontalSizeClass
like an iPad will appear

442
00:24:11.206 --> 00:24:12.936 A:middle
in a popover without you having

443
00:24:12.936 --> 00:24:14.986 A:middle
to write any device-checking
code.

444
00:24:16.046 --> 00:24:18.246 A:middle
So you can learn
more about how all

445
00:24:18.246 --> 00:24:21.646 A:middle
of this adaptive presentation
machinery works by checking

446
00:24:21.646 --> 00:24:23.466 A:middle
out A Look Inside
View Controllers,

447
00:24:23.536 --> 00:24:24.826 A:middle
Thursday morning in the Mission.

448
00:24:25.146 --> 00:24:26.796 A:middle
I've seen this talk
a couple of times.

449
00:24:27.016 --> 00:24:28.506 A:middle
It's really great if you want

450
00:24:28.506 --> 00:24:31.416 A:middle
to understand the nitty-gritty
behind how all these

451
00:24:31.446 --> 00:24:33.776 A:middle
presentation controllers
work, and especially

452
00:24:33.776 --> 00:24:35.016 A:middle
if you're thinking, hey,

453
00:24:35.016 --> 00:24:37.456 A:middle
this built-in UIKit
stuff is fantastic.

454
00:24:37.816 --> 00:24:40.636 A:middle
I want to build my own
presentation controllers

455
00:24:40.866 --> 00:24:42.196 A:middle
that are also adaptive.

456
00:24:42.346 --> 00:24:45.066 A:middle
This talk will teach
you how to do that.

457
00:24:45.336 --> 00:24:49.326 A:middle
So, what we've been talking
about for a while is tools

458
00:24:49.326 --> 00:24:53.066 A:middle
that we're giving you via the
API to write adaptive code,

459
00:24:53.666 --> 00:24:56.316 A:middle
but there's another step

460
00:24:56.606 --> 00:24:58.656 A:middle
to writing great code
and that's Testing.

461
00:24:59.416 --> 00:25:01.896 A:middle
So we're giving you another
great tool that we're excited

462
00:25:01.896 --> 00:25:06.106 A:middle
about in the iOS simulator
and that is the ability

463
00:25:06.166 --> 00:25:10.296 A:middle
to resize the physical
simulated hardware.

464
00:25:11.746 --> 00:25:14.056 A:middle
And, so I don't know if you
can see it on the screen.

465
00:25:14.056 --> 00:25:17.526 A:middle
It's a little small, but
you'll find in your SDK

466
00:25:17.526 --> 00:25:21.176 A:middle
if you haven't found it yet, and
you launch the iOS simulator,

467
00:25:21.176 --> 00:25:23.536 A:middle
there are two new devices
that you can select.

468
00:25:24.036 --> 00:25:27.826 A:middle
One is a resizable iPad and
one is a resizable iPhone.

469
00:25:28.596 --> 00:25:32.236 A:middle
You can use these to actually
punch in custom values

470
00:25:32.466 --> 00:25:35.906 A:middle
for the hardware size of

and test the adaptivity
of your code on the fly.

[ Applause ]

473
00:25:47.176 --> 00:25:51.156 A:middle
We're really excited for how
this kind of thing can make,

474
00:25:51.156 --> 00:25:52.876 A:middle
can change the way
we architect apps

475
00:25:53.076 --> 00:25:56.316 A:middle
because we can architect
things the way that we intend

476
00:25:56.316 --> 00:25:58.976 A:middle
and then test that our
intentions are doing what we

477
00:25:59.036 --> 00:26:00.366 A:middle
thought that they
were going to do.

478
00:26:01.096 --> 00:26:03.646 A:middle
So I actually stole this
app you see on-screen

479
00:26:04.006 --> 00:26:07.176 A:middle
from the A Look Inside
Presentation Controllers talk

480
00:26:07.176 --> 00:26:08.066 A:middle
that I just mentioned,

481
00:26:08.446 --> 00:26:12.656 A:middle
and it has a custom presentation
controller, which is the view

482
00:26:12.656 --> 00:26:14.916 A:middle
that slides out from the right
and it's designed to take

483
00:26:14.916 --> 00:26:16.136 A:middle
to take up a third
of the screen.

484
00:26:16.476 --> 00:26:20.166 A:middle
I went and tested it in the
resizable iPad to make sure

485
00:26:20.166 --> 00:26:21.696 A:middle
that if it was in
a compact width,

486
00:26:22.096 --> 00:26:24.156 A:middle
it would do the right
thing, and sure enough,

487
00:26:24.156 --> 00:26:26.036 A:middle
the guys who wrote
this are really great

488
00:26:26.036 --> 00:26:27.366 A:middle
and it does do the right thing.

489
00:26:27.696 --> 00:26:30.206 A:middle
It presents as an
OverFullScreen presentation

490
00:26:30.866 --> 00:26:31.996 A:middle
in the compact width.

491
00:26:33.036 --> 00:26:37.476 A:middle
So, let's talk about some of the
new things in iOS 8 for UIKit

492
00:26:37.476 --> 00:26:39.066 A:middle
for customizing user interface.

493
00:26:39.676 --> 00:26:42.966 A:middle
Of a new class called
UIVisualEffectView,

494
00:26:43.366 --> 00:26:45.646 A:middle
the UIView is subclass,
and it's a view

495
00:26:45.646 --> 00:26:48.106 A:middle
that takes UIVisualEffectObject

496
00:26:48.446 --> 00:26:50.966 A:middle
that parameterizes
custom rendering modes

497
00:26:50.966 --> 00:26:53.006 A:middle
for the view itself and
the content inside it.

498
00:26:54.156 --> 00:26:56.266 A:middle
So we're shipping a
couple of different effects

499
00:26:56.576 --> 00:27:00.656 A:middle
that you can use with the visual
effect view to get the effect

500
00:27:00.656 --> 00:27:03.686 A:middle
that you want, and the first
one is the UIBlurEffect.

501
00:27:04.516 --> 00:27:12.066 A:middle
[ Applause ]

502
00:27:12.566 --> 00:27:14.476 A:middle
Believe me I've been
waiting for you guys to get

503
00:27:14.476 --> 00:27:17.426 A:middle
to be able to use this too.

504
00:27:17.576 --> 00:27:19.776 A:middle
So UIBlurEffect will
give you a live blur

505
00:27:19.776 --> 00:27:21.716 A:middle
over the content
where you use it.

506
00:27:22.316 --> 00:27:24.486 A:middle
The second effect
that we're shipping is

507
00:27:24.486 --> 00:27:25.756 A:middle
the UIVibrancyEffect.

508
00:27:26.676 --> 00:27:29.866 A:middle
Now, a vibrancy effect if
you don't know what that is,

509
00:27:30.016 --> 00:27:33.536 A:middle
that refers to the separators
in Notification Center.

510
00:27:34.056 --> 00:27:36.396 A:middle
It may be a little bit
hard to see on this screen,

511
00:27:36.396 --> 00:27:38.666 A:middle
but you can pull out your phone,
pull down Notification Center.

512
00:27:39.016 --> 00:27:40.976 A:middle
Take a look at those
beautiful color-changing,

513
00:27:40.976 --> 00:27:43.566 A:middle
color-dodging separators,
and that's vibrancy.

514
00:27:44.556 --> 00:27:47.306 A:middle
Another thing-I heard a clap
over there, thanks [laughter].

515
00:27:49.076 --> 00:27:52.416 A:middle
Another thing that we're
introducing is Image Assets.

516
00:27:52.416 --> 00:27:55.656 A:middle
Image assets are something that
encapsulate the 1X, the 2X,

517
00:27:55.776 --> 00:27:59.546 A:middle
the iPhone, the iPad
representations of your image

518
00:27:59.546 --> 00:28:02.276 A:middle
in the home matrix thereof,
and it comes with some API

519
00:28:02.276 --> 00:28:05.636 A:middle
that makes it really easy
to get the right images

520
00:28:05.816 --> 00:28:08.396 A:middle
out of the image catalog
because we can use something

521
00:28:08.396 --> 00:28:11.546 A:middle
like image named and
add a parameter to it

522
00:28:11.876 --> 00:28:13.306 A:middle
that takes TraitCollection.

523
00:28:14.246 --> 00:28:15.976 A:middle
And since TraitCollections
are hung right

524
00:28:15.976 --> 00:28:18.986 A:middle
on your view controllers, you
can take that TraitCollection

525
00:28:18.986 --> 00:28:22.166 A:middle
from self and viewDidAppear or
something and apply it directly

526
00:28:22.406 --> 00:28:24.636 A:middle
to an image view in
your view controller,

527
00:28:24.636 --> 00:28:25.916 A:middle
and you'll have the right image.

528
00:28:26.186 --> 00:28:30.886 A:middle
The if statement that is implied
in figuring out 1X, 2X, iPhone,

529
00:28:30.976 --> 00:28:33.846 A:middle
iPad, et cetera, is all encoded
within the TraitCollection,

530
00:28:34.046 --> 00:28:35.616 A:middle
which you don't have
to do any work for.

531
00:28:35.616 --> 00:28:38.026 A:middle
It comes directly with
your view controller.

532
00:28:38.906 --> 00:28:39.546 A:middle
Thank you.

533
00:28:40.516 --> 00:28:43.636 A:middle
[ Applause ]

534
00:28:44.136 --> 00:28:47.436 A:middle
Another UI feature
is Condensing Bars.

535
00:28:47.436 --> 00:28:51.946 A:middle
You may be familiar with this
if you've used Safari on iOS 7,

536
00:28:51.946 --> 00:28:53.736 A:middle
and it has a similar concept.

537
00:28:53.736 --> 00:28:55.966 A:middle
When the user scrolls, the
search bars [inaudible] shrink.

538
00:28:56.736 --> 00:29:01.256 A:middle
Well, we've extended that
concept throughout the iOS 8 SDK

539
00:29:01.256 --> 00:29:05.066 A:middle
and given you access to that
sort of behavior in your app.

540
00:29:05.326 --> 00:29:07.606 A:middle
So if you have a navigation
bar, you can make it so that

541
00:29:07.606 --> 00:29:10.036 A:middle
when a user scrolls the
navigation bar gets a little bit

542
00:29:10.036 --> 00:29:14.806 A:middle
smaller, or if you have a
view that has a navigation bar

543
00:29:14.806 --> 00:29:17.466 A:middle
and a toolbar, you can make it
so that when a user scrolls,

544
00:29:17.466 --> 00:29:18.556 A:middle
the navigation bar shrinks

545
00:29:18.556 --> 00:29:20.356 A:middle
and the toolbar disappears
all together.

[ Applause ]

547
00:29:27.046 --> 00:29:29.026 A:middle
So to learn all about some
great things you can do

548
00:29:29.126 --> 00:29:31.896 A:middle
with interface customizations,
we have a talk

549
00:29:32.036 --> 00:29:35.476 A:middle
that is tomorrow called Creating
Custom iOS User Interfaces.

550
00:29:36.916 --> 00:29:40.356 A:middle
So, I alluded earlier
to a feature that is,

551
00:29:40.406 --> 00:29:41.876 A:middle
that we're pushing in iOS 8,

552
00:29:42.276 --> 00:29:43.896 A:middle
which is dynamic
type everywhere.

553
00:29:44.026 --> 00:29:48.206 A:middle
All of Apple's apps have adapted
or have adopted dynamic type

554
00:29:48.256 --> 00:29:52.006 A:middle
and are adapting to the changes
that are required for that.

555
00:29:52.856 --> 00:29:54.256 A:middle
One of the things
that we realize is

556
00:29:54.306 --> 00:29:57.636 A:middle
that table views are
a very common place

557
00:29:57.636 --> 00:30:00.036 A:middle
where text is displayed and
something that we would want

558
00:30:00.036 --> 00:30:03.376 A:middle
to respond to user
text size changes.

559
00:30:03.846 --> 00:30:08.806 A:middle
And so we have made it easier
in iOS 8 for you to respond

560
00:30:08.806 --> 00:30:11.106 A:middle
to these types of
changes by allowing you

561
00:30:11.106 --> 00:30:12.726 A:middle
to have dynamic type rows

562
00:30:12.836 --> 00:30:14.786 A:middle
without actually
implementing the delegate method

563
00:30:14.786 --> 00:30:15.966 A:middle
tableView:heightForRow
AtIndexPath:.

[ Applause ]

565
00:30:23.246 --> 00:30:25.356 A:middle
I know that a lot of you
have been asking for this

566
00:30:25.356 --> 00:30:27.566 A:middle
over the years, and
so now our solution

567
00:30:27.566 --> 00:30:30.136 A:middle
to that is cells can
encapsulate their size

568
00:30:30.136 --> 00:30:30.976 A:middle
and logic inside themselves.

569
00:30:31.516 --> 00:30:37.566 A:middle
[ Applause ]

570
00:30:38.066 --> 00:30:39.656 A:middle
It gets better, actually,

571
00:30:40.216 --> 00:30:44.096 A:middle
because the cells natively
support autolayout.

572
00:30:45.036 --> 00:30:49.556 A:middle
So, yeah, it does
get better, right?

573
00:30:49.556 --> 00:30:51.656 A:middle
And so if you have
constraints in your cells,

574
00:30:51.876 --> 00:30:55.246 A:middle
UIKit can derive the appropriate
height for those cells

575
00:30:55.246 --> 00:30:56.846 A:middle
from the content in
them and the constraints

576
00:30:56.846 --> 00:30:57.706 A:middle
that you place on them.

577
00:30:58.456 --> 00:31:00.106 A:middle
You can do something like this

578
00:31:00.276 --> 00:31:02.036 A:middle
where I'm not implementing
the delegate

579
00:31:02.036 --> 00:31:03.546 A:middle
method heightForRowAtIndexPath.

580
00:31:03.896 --> 00:31:07.166 A:middle
Instead in my cells initializer,
I set some constraints.

581
00:31:07.526 --> 00:31:09.416 A:middle
In this particular
cell, I have a text view

582
00:31:09.416 --> 00:31:10.576 A:middle
that will hold some content.

583
00:31:10.876 --> 00:31:13.576 A:middle
I set a vertical constraint
that just adds some padding

584
00:31:13.866 --> 00:31:16.516 A:middle
around that text view using
the visual format language.

585
00:31:16.676 --> 00:31:20.126 A:middle
I do the same thing on the
horizontal axis, adding padding

586
00:31:20.126 --> 00:31:22.316 A:middle
on the right and left
of that text view,

587
00:31:23.206 --> 00:31:24.836 A:middle
and then when this
cell is created,

588
00:31:24.836 --> 00:31:26.086 A:middle
it will be populated
with some text.

589
00:31:26.696 --> 00:31:28.716 A:middle
The table view will
know how wide it is.

590
00:31:29.386 --> 00:31:32.056 A:middle
We'll be able to take the
content that's in that text view

591
00:31:32.346 --> 00:31:34.786 A:middle
and the margins that I've
set up with autolayout

592
00:31:34.786 --> 00:31:36.466 A:middle
and determine what
the appropriate height

593
00:31:36.516 --> 00:31:38.566 A:middle
for that cell should be
based on that content

594
00:31:38.566 --> 00:31:39.486 A:middle
and the width of the table.

595
00:31:40.796 --> 00:31:43.996 A:middle
If you really like to learn
more about that or if you just

596
00:31:43.996 --> 00:31:47.256 A:middle
like to hear me talk, come
back to this same room two days

597
00:31:47.256 --> 00:31:49.386 A:middle
from now where I'll
be presenting along

hard to wait until this part

but App Extensions.

You've seen this in the keynote,

608
00:32:14.906 --> 00:32:18.036 A:middle
but app extensions are just
going to change the way

609
00:32:18.036 --> 00:32:20.186 A:middle
that we write apps and the way

610
00:32:20.356 --> 00:32:23.436 A:middle
that users enjoy what
we produce for them.

611
00:32:23.796 --> 00:32:28.486 A:middle
We can do things like in
Photos, taking a photo,

612
00:32:28.676 --> 00:32:31.346 A:middle
bringing up a sheet that shows
the extensions that we have,

613
00:32:31.346 --> 00:32:34.116 A:middle
selecting your extension
right there in Photos,

614
00:32:34.356 --> 00:32:36.856 A:middle
applying something like
a filter to that photo,

615
00:32:37.046 --> 00:32:40.066 A:middle
and ending up in Photos
where we always were.

616
00:32:40.326 --> 00:32:42.936 A:middle
We never had to leave the app.

617
00:32:43.366 --> 00:32:45.536 A:middle
And your content is right there

618
00:32:45.576 --> 00:32:47.146 A:middle
for the user at their
fingertips.

619
00:32:47.886 --> 00:32:51.876 A:middle
We can also have sharing
extensions, which allow users

620
00:32:51.876 --> 00:32:55.046 A:middle
to share to your
sharing service right

621
00:32:55.046 --> 00:32:56.196 A:middle
from whatever app they're in.

622
00:32:56.196 --> 00:32:59.036 A:middle
They can share photos,
videos, text, and other content

623
00:32:59.286 --> 00:33:01.646 A:middle
without having to do a
do-si-do over to your app.

624
00:33:02.206 --> 00:33:03.886 A:middle
This will be a better
experience for the user,

625
00:33:03.886 --> 00:33:07.896 A:middle
and it means more people
can share to your app

626
00:33:08.036 --> 00:33:10.416 A:middle
because it will be less
work for them to do so.

627
00:33:11.326 --> 00:33:14.636 A:middle
We also have Notification
Center widgets.

628
00:33:14.966 --> 00:33:17.626 A:middle
You can write a fantastic
Notification Center widget

629
00:33:17.856 --> 00:33:21.076 A:middle
that can end up on my phone
and I can see it every day,

630
00:33:21.076 --> 00:33:24.766 A:middle
and I can be extremely grateful
for you, to you for doing that.

631
00:33:25.696 --> 00:33:28.306 A:middle
So app extensions
open a lot of doors.

632
00:33:28.866 --> 00:33:31.346 A:middle
Some of the big things in iOS 8

633
00:33:31.346 --> 00:33:34.016 A:middle
that you can use app extensions
for, of course, Photos,

634
00:33:34.506 --> 00:33:37.136 A:middle
sharing, Notification Center.

635
00:33:37.476 --> 00:33:40.536 A:middle
It's also possible
to build extensions

636
00:33:40.536 --> 00:33:43.366 A:middle
that don't actually have a user
interface, and a great example

637
00:33:43.366 --> 00:33:46.156 A:middle
of this is the Bing
Translate action without UI

638
00:33:46.726 --> 00:33:49.256 A:middle
that we saw in the keynote.

639
00:33:49.406 --> 00:33:52.866 A:middle
Additionally, you can build
custom file providers.

640
00:33:52.866 --> 00:33:56.596 A:middle
This is something that will
allow the user to use documents

641
00:33:56.596 --> 00:33:59.606 A:middle
from your cloud storage
solution as seamlessly

642
00:33:59.606 --> 00:34:01.976 A:middle
as if those documents
were on iCloud drive,

643
00:34:02.356 --> 00:34:06.116 A:middle
just by your extension providing
them to apps within the system.

644
00:34:06.726 --> 00:34:08.795 A:middle
Additionally, iOS
8 makes it possible

645
00:34:08.795 --> 00:34:10.226 A:middle
to write custom keyboards

646
00:34:10.226 --> 00:34:11.906 A:middle
that will be shared
throughout the system.

The front row likes that.

649
00:34:16.126 --> 00:34:17.866 A:middle
Yeah. To learn more about
building app extensions,

650
00:34:18.036 --> 00:34:20.806 A:middle
we have two great talks today
and tomorrow that will explain

651
00:34:20.806 --> 00:34:21.906 A:middle
to you everything
you need to know

652
00:34:22.146 --> 00:34:26.065 A:middle
about building upon this just
absolutely tremendous technology

653
00:34:26.065 --> 00:34:28.916 A:middle
that is just going
to-iOS 8 is the sign post.

654
00:34:28.916 --> 00:34:30.036 A:middle
It's different from here on out.

655
00:34:31.505 --> 00:34:33.466 A:middle
So some updates to
notifications.

656
00:34:34.626 --> 00:34:37.846 A:middle
Notifications have changed a
bit in particular in the way

657
00:34:37.846 --> 00:34:40.815 A:middle
that we model how users approve

658
00:34:40.815 --> 00:34:42.266 A:middle
of notifications
that appear onscreen.

659
00:34:43.376 --> 00:34:45.806 A:middle
It's always been
true that users have

660
00:34:45.886 --> 00:34:52.686 A:middle
to approve push notifications,
and it wasn't true previously

661
00:34:52.686 --> 00:34:55.176 A:middle
that users would have to
approve local notifications.

662
00:34:55.176 --> 00:34:56.496 A:middle
You could show a
local notification

663
00:34:56.806 --> 00:35:00.096 A:middle
without the user
giving approval to that.

664
00:35:00.096 --> 00:35:03.036 A:middle
So in iOS 8, any
notification that shows UI

665
00:35:03.036 --> 00:35:04.646 A:middle
on the screen is going

666
00:35:04.646 --> 00:35:07.206 A:middle
to require one-time
approval from the user.

667
00:35:08.016 --> 00:35:11.416 A:middle
The flip side to that is you
can send push notifications

668
00:35:11.416 --> 00:35:14.966 A:middle
that don't show UI to the
user, that simply shuttle data

669
00:35:14.966 --> 00:35:17.796 A:middle
to your app, and those
will not, by default,

670
00:35:17.986 --> 00:35:20.216 A:middle
require user approval.

671
00:35:20.466 --> 00:35:22.466 A:middle
So you can just send
notifications to your app,

672
00:35:22.466 --> 00:35:23.956 A:middle
and the user doesn't have to,
doesn't have to worry about it.

673
00:35:24.516 --> 00:35:26.966 A:middle
[ Applause ]

674
00:35:27.466 --> 00:35:30.436 A:middle
Notifications can now also have
actions associated with them.

675
00:35:30.926 --> 00:35:32.766 A:middle
That is, if you want
to display something

676
00:35:32.766 --> 00:35:36.476 A:middle
that has a reply button or other
actions, those can be tacked

677
00:35:36.656 --> 00:35:38.016 A:middle
on to your notifications,

678
00:35:38.016 --> 00:35:41.276 A:middle
and whatever action the user
selects, that will be shuttled

679
00:35:41.276 --> 00:35:43.186 A:middle
over to your app for
your custom logic

680
00:35:43.236 --> 00:35:45.216 A:middle
to be invoked based
on that action.

681
00:35:46.116 --> 00:35:49.276 A:middle
Notifications can also be
location based in iOS 8,

682
00:35:49.556 --> 00:35:52.466 A:middle
so you can pop up a notification
when the user enters

683
00:35:52.466 --> 00:35:54.886 A:middle
or exits a significant
area that you want

684
00:35:54.976 --> 00:35:55.976 A:middle
to show them a notification
about.

this, there's a great talk,

691
00:36:17.606 --> 00:36:20.816 A:middle
What's New in iOS Notifications,
tomorrow afternoon in Nob Hill.

692
00:36:21.766 --> 00:36:24.196 A:middle
So we're introducing
a doc picker in iOS 8.

693
00:36:25.226 --> 00:36:27.246 A:middle
And it looks beautiful-looks
like that.

694
00:36:27.556 --> 00:36:31.296 A:middle
It's, of course, available
on iPad and iPhone,

695
00:36:31.726 --> 00:36:34.186 A:middle
and what's great about this
is we now have system UI

696
00:36:34.836 --> 00:36:36.256 A:middle
for selecting documents.

697
00:36:37.006 --> 00:36:40.726 A:middle
You no longer have to write
completely custom code starting

698
00:36:40.726 --> 00:36:43.796 A:middle
from scratch to give a user a
document picking experience.

699
00:36:44.106 --> 00:36:46.216 A:middle
If you want to be able to
interact with documents

700
00:36:46.486 --> 00:36:48.176 A:middle
in your application,
you can use the

701
00:36:48.176 --> 00:36:51.456 A:middle
UIDocumentPickerViewController
[inaudible] and, of course,

702
00:36:51.496 --> 00:36:53.946 A:middle
since it's a view controller
it gets to take advantage

703
00:36:53.946 --> 00:36:56.746 A:middle
of all the adaptive presentation
and hierarchy machinery

704
00:36:57.076 --> 00:36:58.246 A:middle
that we talked about earlier.

705
00:36:59.116 --> 00:37:02.876 A:middle
This document picker has access
to documents in the local scope,

706
00:37:03.126 --> 00:37:05.516 A:middle
and seamlessly also in
the iCloud drive scope,

707
00:37:06.076 --> 00:37:07.576 A:middle
and finally anybody

708
00:37:07.576 --> 00:37:09.836 A:middle
who is supplying a
document provider extension

709
00:37:09.836 --> 00:37:12.646 A:middle
to the system, those
documents will also appear

710
00:37:12.646 --> 00:37:13.746 A:middle
in the document picker.

711
00:37:13.926 --> 00:37:18.136 A:middle
It's all similarly completely
seamless and easy for the user

712
00:37:18.556 --> 00:37:21.776 A:middle
and your application just gets
a URL back for the document

713
00:37:21.776 --> 00:37:22.846 A:middle
that it needs to open.

714
00:37:23.696 --> 00:37:26.006 A:middle
To learn more about
document picker support,

715
00:37:26.006 --> 00:37:28.136 A:middle
we've got a great talk on
Building a Document-based App

716
00:37:28.136 --> 00:37:29.316 A:middle
in the Marina on Thursday.

717
00:37:30.376 --> 00:37:33.556 A:middle
A quick word about
SDK Modernization.

718
00:37:33.876 --> 00:37:36.876 A:middle
We made a few changes throughout
the headers in the Cocoa

719
00:37:36.876 --> 00:37:41.206 A:middle
and Cocoa Touch APIs, and I just
want to give you a quick rundown

720
00:37:41.206 --> 00:37:43.146 A:middle
of what that's all about.

721
00:37:43.146 --> 00:37:46.216 A:middle
We've annotated all the
designated initializers of class

722
00:37:46.366 --> 00:37:48.396 A:middle
with an
NS-DESIGNATED-INITIALIZER

723
00:37:48.396 --> 00:37:49.506 A:middle
annotation so you know

724
00:37:49.506 --> 00:37:52.546 A:middle
which ones are the designated
initializers, which, of course,

725
00:37:52.546 --> 00:37:53.566 A:middle
you need to know if you're going

726
00:37:53.566 --> 00:37:55.466 A:middle
to be a good subclassing
citizen.

727
00:37:56.476 --> 00:37:59.646 A:middle
Additionally, all
of the return types

728
00:37:59.646 --> 00:38:02.546 A:middle
for initializers have changed
from id to instancetype.

[ Applause ]

730
00:38:07.086 --> 00:38:09.556 A:middle
That will make some of
our autocomplete better.

731
00:38:09.556 --> 00:38:12.256 A:middle
And we've introduced
additional properties in place

732
00:38:12.256 --> 00:38:14.786 A:middle
of classic Cocoa
methods, in particular

733
00:38:14.786 --> 00:38:17.956 A:middle
like the NS object protocol
where hash used to be a method.

734
00:38:17.956 --> 00:38:20.916 A:middle
Hash is now a property
for NS object.

735
00:38:21.396 --> 00:38:24.936 A:middle
And these changes enhance
the experience for use

736
00:38:24.936 --> 00:38:28.056 A:middle
with the Cocoa and Cocoa Touch
APIs, both in Objective C and,

737
00:38:28.056 --> 00:38:30.006 A:middle
in particularly, with Swift.

738
00:38:31.666 --> 00:38:38.106 A:middle
So, Handoff is an opportunity
for your app to participate

739
00:38:38.396 --> 00:38:40.106 A:middle
in a feature that we talked

740
00:38:40.106 --> 00:38:43.876 A:middle
about in the keynote,
which is continuity.

741
00:38:44.116 --> 00:38:49.256 A:middle
Continuity is the thing that
allows users to do something

742
00:38:49.256 --> 00:38:54.206 A:middle
like start an email on their
phone, go to their computer,

743
00:38:55.076 --> 00:38:57.936 A:middle
finish that email, and it's
all seamless experience.

744
00:38:58.546 --> 00:39:02.106 A:middle
Well, with handoff, we're
giving you the opportunity

745
00:39:02.286 --> 00:39:05.596 A:middle
to have user activities of
your own so that they can do

746
00:39:05.596 --> 00:39:09.696 A:middle
that not just with mail or
with other built-in activities,

747
00:39:10.046 --> 00:39:12.006 A:middle
but with your activities
as well.

748
00:39:13.106 --> 00:39:17.776 A:middle
So handoff has a built-in
support for activities in AppKit

749
00:39:17.956 --> 00:39:20.896 A:middle
and UIKit, both natively
support activities

750
00:39:20.896 --> 00:39:26.816 A:middle
in their document
classes, and you'll be able

751
00:39:26.816 --> 00:39:28.176 A:middle
to use that out of the box.

752
00:39:28.406 --> 00:39:31.846 A:middle
To learn more about handoff,
check out the Adopting Handoff

753
00:39:31.846 --> 00:39:34.036 A:middle
in iOS talk tomorrow
in the Mission.

754
00:39:35.196 --> 00:39:39.336 A:middle
So, there's a whole lot of
stuff that has changed here.

755
00:39:40.646 --> 00:39:42.166 A:middle
Lots of new things.

756
00:39:42.166 --> 00:39:46.966 A:middle
We also have several
brand-new frameworks in iOS 8,

757
00:39:47.246 --> 00:39:50.376 A:middle
and I don't really have time
to talk in any kind of depth

758
00:39:50.376 --> 00:39:53.316 A:middle
about these things, but I
want to give you an idea,

759
00:39:53.316 --> 00:39:57.556 A:middle
a taste of what is out there so
you can see what other sessions

760
00:39:57.556 --> 00:39:58.696 A:middle
that you'd like to attend

761
00:39:58.736 --> 00:40:00.866 A:middle
because these frameworks
allow you to build apps

762
00:40:00.896 --> 00:40:04.006 A:middle
that you simply could
not build before iOS 8.

763
00:40:04.336 --> 00:40:05.136 A:middle
And that's fantastic.

764
00:40:05.826 --> 00:40:08.246 A:middle
So, of course, first is one
that we've already touched on.

765
00:40:08.526 --> 00:40:12.856 A:middle
Notification Center will
support you building extensions

766
00:40:12.856 --> 00:40:15.296 A:middle
that add widgets to the
Notification Center on iOS.

767
00:40:15.346 --> 00:40:17.666 A:middle
So that's
notificationcenter.framework,

768
00:40:18.006 --> 00:40:20.666 A:middle
and you can learn
about that by checking

769
00:40:20.666 --> 00:40:23.366 A:middle
out the Building
App Extensions talk.

770
00:40:24.546 --> 00:40:26.646 A:middle
We also have a brand-new
Photos framework.

771
00:40:27.186 --> 00:40:30.136 A:middle
This will give you
complete read/write access

772
00:40:30.526 --> 00:40:32.176 A:middle
to the photos library.

773
00:40:32.726 --> 00:40:36.166 A:middle
This means you can do whatever
your application needs to do

774
00:40:36.346 --> 00:40:38.866 A:middle
to provide the best user
experience possible.

775
00:40:39.256 --> 00:40:40.536 A:middle
It can delete photos.

776
00:40:40.676 --> 00:40:42.096 A:middle
It can do non-destructive edits.

777
00:40:42.096 --> 00:40:44.196 A:middle
It can do whatever
it needs to do

778
00:40:44.416 --> 00:40:46.196 A:middle
so that the user
gets what they need.

779
00:40:47.416 --> 00:40:50.736 A:middle
While this isn't actually
in the Photos talk

780
00:40:51.316 --> 00:40:54.356 A:middle
or in the Photos framework, I
do want to take this opportunity

781
00:40:54.356 --> 00:40:57.516 A:middle
to point out that iOS 8 also
brings custom Core Image

782
00:40:57.586 --> 00:41:01.026 A:middle
filters, and so you'll be able
to use these on your photos

783
00:41:01.256 --> 00:41:02.976 A:middle
as well as videos in iOS 8.

00:41:12.186 --> 00:41:14.766 A:middle
and this framework is
absolutely spectacular.

787
00:41:14.766 --> 00:41:17.536 A:middle
I really can't say enough
good things about it.

788
00:41:17.836 --> 00:41:20.686 A:middle
It gives you more control than
you ever had over the data

789
00:41:20.686 --> 00:41:22.296 A:middle
that you put in the cloud.

790
00:41:23.316 --> 00:41:27.306 A:middle
And what really makes this
spectacular is you can use

791
00:41:27.306 --> 00:41:30.636 A:middle
CloudKit to build a
client server application

792
00:41:30.866 --> 00:41:32.156 A:middle
without building
the server side.

793
00:41:32.826 --> 00:41:35.436 A:middle
You can define that
on the client side

794
00:41:35.436 --> 00:41:37.486 A:middle
and let Apple take
care of it for you.

795
00:41:38.196 --> 00:41:40.126 A:middle
So, you know, I can't even wait

796
00:41:40.126 --> 00:41:42.386 A:middle
to see what startups
come out of this.

797
00:41:42.386 --> 00:41:45.886 A:middle
This will be fantastic, and
we love CloudKit so much

798
00:41:46.246 --> 00:41:48.466 A:middle
that we built iCloud
Drive and Photos

799
00:41:48.466 --> 00:41:50.016 A:middle
in the cloud on top of it.

800
00:41:50.206 --> 00:41:51.726 A:middle
It's a fantastic technology,

801
00:41:51.726 --> 00:41:54.736 A:middle
and you'll love building
your apps on top of it.

802
00:41:54.976 --> 00:41:56.866 A:middle
Another new framework
is HealthKit.

803
00:41:57.226 --> 00:42:00.466 A:middle
HealthKit brings all of
the biometric information

804
00:42:00.466 --> 00:42:01.696 A:middle
from the various devices

805
00:42:01.696 --> 00:42:04.276 A:middle
that your user has
all into one place.

806
00:42:04.276 --> 00:42:08.696 A:middle
So this information is shared
across apps rather than siloed

807
00:42:08.696 --> 00:42:12.436 A:middle
into one app that has one
biometric device information

808
00:42:12.436 --> 00:42:15.236 A:middle
and another app that has another
biometric device information.

809
00:42:15.536 --> 00:42:16.346 A:middle
It's all shared.

810
00:42:16.406 --> 00:42:21.116 A:middle
So you can use that to
create a perfect experience

811
00:42:21.116 --> 00:42:23.906 A:middle
for your user based on
all of the biometric data

812
00:42:23.906 --> 00:42:26.386 A:middle
that is available from
all of their accessories.

813
00:42:27.466 --> 00:42:30.136 A:middle
Similarly, we are
introducing a HomeKit,

814
00:42:30.576 --> 00:42:33.186 A:middle
which does the same thing
for connected home devices.

815
00:42:33.456 --> 00:42:36.356 A:middle
It puts all of that
information in one place

816
00:42:36.696 --> 00:42:39.336 A:middle
so that you can build an
app that does everything

817
00:42:39.336 --> 00:42:43.316 A:middle
that a user needs for their
connected home, accessing all

818
00:42:43.316 --> 00:42:44.956 A:middle
of those things in one place.

819
00:42:44.956 --> 00:42:48.646 A:middle
We also have a new local
authentication framework.

820
00:42:49.806 --> 00:42:51.626 A:middle
This allows you to
leverage the power

821
00:42:51.626 --> 00:42:54.976 A:middle
of biometric authentication
in your own app.

822
00:42:55.156 --> 00:42:57.426 A:middle
And as you probably know from
having watched the keynote,

823
00:42:57.616 --> 00:42:58.656 A:middle
this means that you get

824
00:42:58.656 --> 00:43:01.356 A:middle
to use Touch ID right
inside your application.

825
00:43:01.666 --> 00:43:03.926 A:middle
That's great and we have a
talk that you can go check

826
00:43:04.446 --> 00:43:06.386 A:middle
out to learn more
about how to do that.

827
00:43:07.296 --> 00:43:10.226 A:middle
We're also bringing
SceneKit to iOS 8.

828
00:43:11.086 --> 00:43:14.506 A:middle
SceneKit is a great framework
for building 3D renderings,

829
00:43:14.916 --> 00:43:17.136 A:middle
and we've had it on
the Mac for a year.

830
00:43:17.376 --> 00:43:18.826 A:middle
We're now bringing it to iOS.

831
00:43:18.826 --> 00:43:21.236 A:middle
Now we have a great
cross-platform solution

832
00:43:21.476 --> 00:43:22.906 A:middle
for doing 3D rendering.

833
00:43:23.116 --> 00:43:25.406 A:middle
Those of you who have already
used SceneKit, you're going

834
00:43:25.406 --> 00:43:26.816 A:middle
to love this; those
of you who haven't,

835
00:43:27.086 --> 00:43:28.686 A:middle
you're also going to love it.

836
00:43:29.656 --> 00:43:32.426 A:middle
Everybody is going to love it.

837
00:43:32.426 --> 00:43:33.966 A:middle
So that's all the
brand new frameworks.

838
00:43:34.036 --> 00:43:35.586 A:middle
That's not all the
changes though.

839
00:43:35.586 --> 00:43:37.556 A:middle
I'll point out one
other framework

840
00:43:37.596 --> 00:43:40.486 A:middle
that has made some significant
changes, which is Core Location.

841
00:43:40.906 --> 00:43:43.516 A:middle
Core location now
makes it possible

842
00:43:43.756 --> 00:43:46.716 A:middle
to get the user's
location details indoors,

843
00:43:47.046 --> 00:43:50.496 A:middle
and by that I mean, you can
get what floor the user is on,

844
00:43:50.736 --> 00:43:51.976 A:middle
not just where they are.

845
00:43:52.516 --> 00:43:57.646 A:middle
[ Applause ]

846
00:43:58.146 --> 00:43:59.226 A:middle
Isn't it great to build apps

847
00:43:59.226 --> 00:44:00.936 A:middle
that you just have
never built before?

848
00:44:01.426 --> 00:44:03.376 A:middle
I'm excited.

849
00:44:03.796 --> 00:44:05.556 A:middle
We also have new APIs
and core location

850
00:44:05.556 --> 00:44:08.416 A:middle
that will make it
easier to save power

851
00:44:08.416 --> 00:44:10.746 A:middle
when getting significant
location updates.

852
00:44:10.746 --> 00:44:12.306 A:middle
So that'll be better
for everyone.

853
00:44:12.306 --> 00:44:14.326 A:middle
I'm a big power magnet myself,

854
00:44:14.646 --> 00:44:17.206 A:middle
so using these will enhance
everyone's experience.

855
00:44:17.666 --> 00:44:20.866 A:middle
We're also changing
the user approval model

856
00:44:20.866 --> 00:44:24.816 A:middle
around core location so
that users can now choose

857
00:44:24.816 --> 00:44:28.486 A:middle
to approve your app either
all the time for location use,

858
00:44:28.656 --> 00:44:30.576 A:middle
or only give it,
you can just request

859
00:44:30.626 --> 00:44:32.386 A:middle
to be approved only
when you're in use.

860
00:44:32.386 --> 00:44:34.246 A:middle
So the user can rest assured

861
00:44:34.486 --> 00:44:37.086 A:middle
that your app is
not using location

862
00:44:37.236 --> 00:44:40.236 A:middle
and not draining the battery,
not stealing any secrets

863
00:44:40.376 --> 00:44:42.076 A:middle
when your app is not in use.

864
00:44:43.186 --> 00:44:44.576 A:middle
So that's a change
to core location.

865
00:44:45.926 --> 00:44:51.176 A:middle
So, to finish up here I
want to reiterate some ideas

866
00:44:51.176 --> 00:44:56.226 A:middle
about the design philosophy
because, really, iOS 8 is a mark

867
00:44:56.226 --> 00:45:00.116 A:middle
in the sand for how we think
about building apps in addition

868
00:45:00.336 --> 00:45:01.726 A:middle
to all of its new API.

869
00:45:03.156 --> 00:45:06.836 A:middle
So, we're going to be centered
around building reusable code

870
00:45:06.836 --> 00:45:11.106 A:middle
that is device agnostic, that is
interface orientation agnostic,

871
00:45:11.476 --> 00:45:16.046 A:middle
that is adaptive, so we can use
the tools that are presented

872
00:45:16.126 --> 00:45:19.676 A:middle
in iOS 8 to simplify our
layout by using things

873
00:45:19.676 --> 00:45:21.856 A:middle
like size classes so
we're not worrying

874
00:45:21.856 --> 00:45:24.446 A:middle
about what the specific
size of things are.

875
00:45:24.696 --> 00:45:27.496 A:middle
We use a size class to make
a determination whether it's

876
00:45:27.496 --> 00:45:30.286 A:middle
compact or regular, and
we can test those things

877
00:45:30.286 --> 00:45:32.396 A:middle
out using the resizable
simulator.

878
00:45:33.986 --> 00:45:39.546 A:middle
We can use the iPhone and
iPad code in a unified way

879
00:45:39.856 --> 00:45:42.916 A:middle
so that we only have one bit of
code that does the right thing

880
00:45:42.916 --> 00:45:45.696 A:middle
on all devices, and we're
bringing adaptive view

881
00:45:45.696 --> 00:45:48.666 A:middle
controller technology to you
that will allow you to do that.

882
00:45:49.476 --> 00:45:52.726 A:middle
You can integrate into the
system now using app extensions

883
00:45:52.996 --> 00:45:56.196 A:middle
so that the user can do
more things in more places

884
00:45:56.196 --> 00:45:59.336 A:middle
than ever before, and your
app can be more useful

885
00:45:59.336 --> 00:46:00.576 A:middle
for them than it's ever done.
